TJ C.,a week ago, 5 stars ,Very good latte. The pistachio croissant was also delicious.
Zealous Void,a week ago, 4 stars ,"Always friendly and fast service, good supplier for coffee beans and supplies. The price point is a bit high for daily visits."
Danny S,a week ago, 5 stars ,Love the oat-milk cappuccino!
Luciano Paciornick,2 weeks ago, 4 stars ,
Roger Velazquez,3 weeks ago, 4 stars ,"(Translated by Google) A place where you can buy coffee, more marketing than product, more packaging than good ingredients. I asked for a coffee in the Chemex preparation method, and the Colombian coffee lacked acidity, aroma, body, well below the acceptable quality level. The sign outside the coffee shop says Roasters, but they don't roast there, just an over-marketed coffee shop. Accessible prices. They have Wi-Fi.

(Original)
Un sitio donde puedes comprar café, más marketing que producto, más empaque que ingredientes buenos. Pedí un café en método de preparación Chemex, y el café Colombiano, carecía de acidez, aroma, cuerpo, muy por debajo del nivel de calidad aceptable. El letrero afuera de la cafetería dice Tostadores, pero no tuestan ahí, un simple expendio de café con marketing excesivo. Precioa accesibles. Cuentan con Wifi."

Will Grafham,a month ago, 5 stars ,"Best vibe, taste, service, and most reasonably priced coffee shop I’ve tried in Toronto! Had a oat cappuccino and usually it’s made poorly when using this type of milk but it came out really well. Everything is spaced out well too, unlike other small coffee shops where conversation is hard to have. Will definitely be back to try different brews."
Rabina Chand,a month ago, 5 stars ,Love everything they serve. My fav is the almond croissant..must try that. Coffee is amazing too.

Janice Chen,3 months ago, 5 stars ,
J B,3 months ago, 2 stars ,"It's okay if a place doesn't have WiFi, but here they have WiFi sign with password but it never works. Employees don't seem to care about that either. They simply answer ""They don't know why it's not working. It works for some"". In fact, it doesn't work for anyone. They won't do anything to help with WiFi because they say their system relies on that WiFi and doing anything is risky.

AMAZING coffee bway! Love their single estate blends."
Andrew Doppenberg,3 months ago, 4 stars ,Good coffee at a decent price. Could use more seating inside.
Mr JAMIE D. TORONTO,3 months ago, 4 stars ,"Amazing pastries and warm service. The sea salt hot chocolate is beyond delicious. The space is super cute, just tiny so a tad on the noisy side. Not ideal as a workspace or hangout it you're catching up with an old friend like I was."

Raha Bahrehdar,4 months ago, 5 stars ,Loved their scones! Staffs are very nice and friendly
Cecilia Mok,4 months ago, 5 stars ,"Small coffee shop with an incredibly big menu of coffee and brewing methods. You can buy beans and grinds here too. They will make custom mix for you if you wish too. Brew bar offers more than the typical offerings: drip, aeropress, chemex, and syphon too! Service is fast and friendly. Had a v60 drip, cappuccino with oatmilk, cheddar and chive scone and ham and cheese croissant. The pastries were heated up and great! Drinks were also good. Will be back to try more! There is seating inside and outside too."
amanda simard,4 months ago, 3 stars ,The coffee is good but the service was subpar at the time.
Iris Li,4 months ago, 5 stars ,This is my frequent coffee-to-go place whenever I’m at Toronto. I like bold taste coffee and the coffee here just suits my taste. The croissant is nice too.

John Metaxas,7 months ago, 5 stars ,"New fav spot! I’m obsessed with their fredo cappuccino with crema. It’s just like the coffees I would drink on my vacations in Greece.

Jose Vieitez,7 months ago, 5 stars ,Amazing staff and great coffee!!
Negar Shahrokh,8 months ago, 5 stars ,What a beautiful little spot! So many coffee options. The coffee and pastries were very good.
Kevin,8 months ago, 5 stars ,"I’m obsessed with this place! They have a cool interior design, professional and friendly baristas, and the best filled croissants! So far, I’ve tried their Turkish coffee (they call it Greek coffee in the menu), banana walnut croissant, and pistachio croissant. My favorite is the banana walnuts so far but I’m going back to try other ones as well. The only issue is that their roasted beans are slightly overpriced but I like that they sell them in sealed reusable bags."
Dave,8 months ago, 5 stars ,"Friendly and attentive staff, a wide variety of coffee, and the option to buy niche and interesting coffee brewing devices. The selection of coffee, along with the variety of brewing techniques, make this a must visit cafe on it's own, but the baristas truly made the experience for me. After a small problem with one of the machines, the barista remade my coffee 3 times until it was up to par, and went out of his way to ensure he made me the best cup of coffee possible."
Matthew Lothian,8 months ago, 5 stars ,The espresso taste is really good. The croissant was delicious too. Nice decor inside and plenty of patio space outside. Friendly service.

Alin S.,8 months ago, 5 stars ,"Great neighborhood place, knows their regulars, and decent food options to go with your coffee. There's a lot of people here during weekends but the staff are really quick so there's not a lot of waiting time.

Most likely pet friendly. Very often you'll see dogs just outside, and on the odd day you'll spot a small cat in a trolley"
Quarrington Z,8 months ago, 3 stars ,Best croissant ever!
Jay Canada,8 months ago, 5 stars ,"Unfortunately, this cup of single origin americano was over-extracted. Grinds are too fine and there are coffee bean sediments at the bottom of the cup. Also, over-extraction caused the coffee way too sour and astringent, undrinkable . For a $4.5 americano, I hoped it is at least decently crafted. However, I consider this to be an isolated event and would try again next time."

Plus nice to be supporting a small, local business 😊"
Ricardo Porter,9 months ago, 5 stars ,I tried a cortado because I wanted to taste how well the espresso shot was pulled and I was not disappointed. Great technique in preparing and pulling the shot and milk was the perfect texture and temperature. Will be back.

Will Beekman,10 months ago, 5 stars ,"I ordered coffee and scones. I liked their coffee, atmosphere, and location. The owner and the staff were very friendly with good customer service.

Dionyssis Protopapas,11 months ago, 5 stars ,"I tried their hot and iced chai latte and I loved them both! My friend attests to their great quality coffee (both in drinks and beans). Their pastries are fine. I had their almond croissant which was good but overpriced. Great service.
Overall, great to grab coffee from or hang around in."
Shayan Sohail,11 months ago, 5 stars ,This is the place for spanakopita and tyropita (spinach and cheese pie)!
Nicole Brown,11 months ago, 5 stars ,Good vibe of this place. Spanish latte highly recommended
Sara Ameri,11 months ago, 1 star ,Great coffee & amazing almond croissants!
Elizabeth T.,11 months ago, 3 stars ,Can't say how the coffee is since I never got to order anything despite waiting in line for 10 mins. The barista was chatting up with a customer while very slowly preparing the order. The other baristas were just idly looking around and at me waiting in line but none of them seemed willing to take an order. I was in a hurry so I just left and got my mid-day coffee somewhere else. Not bothering with this place again.
Andy Schoenhofer,11 months ago, 5 stars ,
Oliver Belfield,11 months ago, 5 stars ,"Great service from nice staff. Interesting collection of roasts and beans, and ways to brew them. Can use Ritual to pre-order."

Alexander Cappellazzo,11 months ago, 5 stars ,"After walking past this place on my way to work each morning, I decided to stop in for a latte. Milk was so smooth, espresso extracted perfectly. One of the best lattes I’ve had in a while!"
Parastaar Sutaria,11 months ago, 5 stars ,I have only been here once but I am giving a 5-star rating for this place being so pocket friendly while delivering great and artisanal coffee experience.

Manuel Mora,a year ago, 5 stars ,"Found Coffee Island by doing a Google search for coffee shops near the hotel I was staying at. I intended to get take out only, but it was so cute that I ended up sitting in for a little while. I got a drip coffee and a flavoured croissant, and they were both very good! I noticed that the staff knew a lot of the regulars’ names and orders, and helped someone purchase whole beans as a gift. Overall, a great experience at Coffee Island!"
Camila Ponte,a year ago, 5 stars ,"I loved the coffee. I tried the Sumatra. I had never had Syphon coffee and was very impressed. They have 4-5 different brewing methods. The baristas are pretty knowledgeable as well.
The croissant was whatever, I would say stick to the coffee, don't bother with the food."

James Kruk,a year ago, 5 stars ,"Some rude/unpleasant staff. It was my first visit. I was just asking about their products and learn about their original coffee. It seems they were not too enthusiastic or customer friendly for that matter. Never coming here again. Their regular brew was mediocre, but price was reasonable.

Overall decor and atmosphere was pleasant."

Jay HJ Lee,a year ago, 5 stars ,
Aynell Rodriguez,a year ago, 5 stars ,"I visited Coffee Island for the second time and when I walked in, barista (tall girl with curly hair and glasses) was sweeping the floor and without washing hands started taking my order. I asked for dark roast and since the dark roast coffee container was almost empty, she just topped up my cup from the medium roast container. If that wasn't enough, the blueberry scone I ordered was rubbery and not really fresh. It's a shame because I really liked their coffee on my first visit."

stephen bodiam,a year ago, 3 stars ,"Great coffee, atmosphere, and service. Great place to kickoff your day."
Pauline Stevens,a year ago, 5 stars ,"Pandemic update: their service & coffee are still exceptional. One note - when ordering, be prepared that they have a lot of cup sizes to offer. 12 Oz is closer to your expected regular size in any other high quality coffee chain. I keep making mistake with ordering 8 Oz :)

This coffee place also has a lot of very tasty pastries. You should check it out!

Great coffee, fast service, welcoming environment. They support tap payments and Ritual. Their service overall gets better each day. Fantastic"

Andreas Tassis,a year ago, 5 stars ,I live in Greece which is where the first Coffe Island started and with me living in the centre of Athens im surrounded by Coffee Island shops.Years ago I went to a Coffee Island for the first time with a friend where I got a cold chocolate with strawberry flavor and since then that's the only thing that I've been purchasing from that chainsaw for years.I highly recommended to buy cold chocolate with strawberry flavor since it's to die for but idk if they will make it the same in Toronto

Shim Mannan,a year ago, 5 stars ,"The environment here is really unfriendly. I was translating for a friend and the staff seemed annoyed with us. They were completely uninterested in answering questions we had about the menu. Admittedly, the coffee selection is impressive as are the modes of preparation."
Lee Balki,a year ago, 5 stars ,"Long time customer here.  I've probably spent over 1,000$ here as I live 1 minute away.  I ALWAYS support small business over Starbucks and Tim Hortons so would support this place whenever I could.  Their prices are more than Tim's or Starbucks but again, I don't care as I prefer to support small businesses and would rather support the local community. However, I dealt with a disgustingly rude staff member a few weeks ago and will never be attending this coffee shop again."

Michelle W,a year ago, 5 stars ,"Coffee Island offers a good selection of coffees with a wide range of brewing methods.  But the staff were not particularly friendly or interested in discussing their products.  I ordered a light roast and the staff secretly pumped medium roast into the cup, probably because the light roast had run out... (at 9:45 in the morning?)."

I don't feel comfortable been attended to by her. I love coffee, I go to coffee shops frequently and, I can say that it's not common to see baristas like her."
NihilistsRUs,2 years ago, 5 stars ,"Hands down one of the best places to get coffee in Toronto. They have an amazing selection of single source java and the taste gets me every time. Not too sour or bitter, just the right balance that doesn't make you acidic:). Oh, and their chocolate almond croissant- the best I've had in Toronto"
Hayley Mauritis,2 years ago, 5 stars ,"This is a cute little place on the Bay and Wellesley corridor and they have really nice staff! We were on a fall walk and didn't carry any credit cards on us. We had recently activated google pay (so, we weren't sure if it would work or not).

We told the lady at the counter to try charging us first to make sure it went through - and she was like ""that's fine, you guys obviously live in the area - you can drop by and pay later if it does not work""

Our payment worked :)

Very genuine and friendly customer service - that's really difficult to find these days. Kudos to their staff!

The coffee was great. They also have flavored hot chocolate (my wife tried the strawberry one - it tasted like the red quality street chocolate, for the one's who know it!)

Great place. Do check out if you are in the neighborhood."
Kev N,2 years ago, 5 stars ,"The coffee and espresso is so flavourful and delicious. The croissants are buttery and light - among the best I’ve had in the city. The staff are so warm, knowledgeable and friendly making this my favourite cafe in TO"

Abraham Aguilar,2 years ago, 5 stars ,Nothing short of an overall amazing experience is to be expected when visiting this wonderful establishment. The service and ambience of the place are both great and the quality of both the variety of hot and cold beverages I have tried are top notch. The menu items are also very reasonably priced. It's located near Queen's park so you can't go wrong stopping by for a coffee and pastry on your way to the park. Highly recommend!

Today the barista was not wearing a mask and not washing hands between cleaning the counter and serving food.  The latte was good, but I couldn't eat the croissant after it was touched with unwashed hands."

Hope we have the chance to meet you once again at our coffee shop. Good day!"
Marco B.,2 years ago, 5 stars ,"2020.09.12. A quick visit for a walkthrough coffee. I had my ""Turkish Coffee"" prepared on hot sand. One comment to the staff ""Please wear your mask at all tines"". Sat on the patio outside.

2020.08.30. The afternoon walk was on Bay Street North. This time had a ""Turkish Coffee"" prepared in hot sand at ""Coffee Island"". This was my first ""Turkish Coffee"" since 9th of August 2020. It was a strong good coffee."

Susanna Huong,2 years ago, 5 stars ,"Awesome coffee spot. You can literally get coffee any way you like it.

Ying Wu,2 years ago, 5 stars ,It is one the best coffee places I have tried in the downtown. They have variety of exciting coffee beans from all around the world. The staff are very knowledgeable and they can help you figure out the flavour you like.
Jonathan Cote,2 years ago, 4 stars ,"Use to really like this coffee shop but service has been lacking. This kid made a latte when my friend ordered a cappuccino. Asked before grabbing the drink if this was a latte because the foam was very thin. The barista replied “ oh it’s the same thing “ ... DID NOT even bothered to offer to make a new one , just went back doing his own thing.... that kinda ruined my liking of this place sorry.

Just shows he doesn’t even know the difference between a cappuccino and latte.

Anyways, always crowded. It’s great that they have outdoor seating, and it’s dog friendly but unfortunately the way the building is built creates a massive wind tunnel. So it’s always very windy when sitting outdoor during the summer."

Freya,4 years ago, 4 stars ,"I’m not sure why this place is rated this well given how terrible my experience was. I came in looking to have an iced mocha - a very typical drink available in most cafes; but I suppose not here.

As I was asking if it was available and told no by the person at the counter, i said can I order hot mocha with ice. He said sure; but then out of nowhere the owner (or manager?) maybe in the most patronizing tone told me that it’s very important to know your drink and that the only way to make an iced mocha is by making it an ice blended drink. She continued on saying that ""you need to trust us on this; how else would you make an iced mocha if not to blend it with ice "". I held off my thought since I really didn’t  want to make any scene there; but FYI ma’am; people have been making iced mochas since forever. In my mind also, what kind of a cafe would this be with this kind of manager/owner. Even another customer next to me said in front of an employee that she’s had lots of iced mochas in other cafes.

So I went on to order and iced latte and was asked if I wanted to add a chocolate shot in it; and I said why not. But I got the drink and realized wow - I now kind of understand why; this was possibly the worst ""iced latte"" I’ve ever had in my life. I’ve been drinking coffee since I was 6 so I know a thing or two about the drinks; and that was by no means an iced latte. I think McDonald’s iced coffee might have been a better choice.

The only salvation for this place was the nice little patio it has with good internet; but that’s about it I’d say. I’d not be coming back - that’s for sure"

Afnan A,4 years ago, 5 stars ,"I've only tried their coffee. It is not my favourite independent (no sure they are independent, but this is the only location I know) coffee shop downtown, but it's definitely better than all the chains. Also a little pricey. But I'd rather pay a couple of bucks more for a good coffee. They have quite a bit of cutesy hipster coffee apparel if you're into that."

Mohammad Dahman,5 years ago, 5 stars ,"Nothing that special, my americano was was decent and they had a station to bag and roast beans in “bulk”. So wouldn’t return personally but I also hate routine so your mileage may vary.

Wifi was speedy, service was speedy, I like the rotating specialty coffees. Seating for maybe 15 people max so imo not a place to go with a big group to camp out and do work at. Seats don’t have backs, but there’s plugs!"

Will be back though as they change up their coffee selections often.

But I feel really disappointed with the service. The young ladies at the counter always take my order incorrectly. They need to pay more attention to my asking such as ""to -go"" or ""not toasted""."
