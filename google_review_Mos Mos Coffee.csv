Nella Tadic,4 days ago, 5 stars ,"Best coffee in town. Service is always fantastic. But nothing beats the bakery. This Mos Mos is different from the other chains,
the reason they stand out is def because

Maria Mejia,a month ago, 2 stars ,"Heard a lot of people recommended the coffee from this cafe and I FINALLY made my visit! 😜Mos Mos Coffee is located in Downtown Toronto and they serve a variety of coffee and pastries💕 (lots of cute donuts, all calling out to me!) This time, I got….

☕️Candamom Chai Latté ☕️
I actually have not tried this latte, I was looking for something that has no sugar and the waiter recommended this to me! 🥰It is one of my favourite now, I will definitely come back and get it again! 🤭The Chai flavour is not as heavy as I thought it would be and every sip I drank was very soothing. 😋If you are looking for something with no sugar but more on the milky side, this is definitely something you should try out! 🤠

🍋 Lemon Poppyseed Loaf 🍋
This was calling out to me, I am totally a fan of lemon poppyseed loaf. 😋Their loaf was very yummy and rich in lemon flavour! It is more on the sweeter side and I wish there were more lemon flavour but totally loved it! 🤠

Other than Lattes, they also serve different coffees like flat white, Americano. 💕I have heard that their Matcha latte is very very good but they cannot do no sugar so I did not get to try this time! 👀Will definitely come back for the Candamom Chai Latte!😌

Thank you for yummy treats! 🤍"
Saiema Zia,2 months ago, 5 stars ,Hi Vanessa - thank you for visiting and we're glad you enjoyed everything! We have a Ceremonial Matcha that has no sugar and we're able to make the Masala and Ginger Chai unsweetened as well. Come back in the spring/summer for our Lemon Blueberry Loaf if you like lemon! :)
aimee l,2 months ago, 5 stars ,"I came to the coffee shop since I had a couple hours to spare and wanted to study and do some work. Their wifi has a bunch of sites blocked which meant I only had access to my email. All of my google docs were not accessible and my online drive for school was also not accessible. For the price of the coffee I would at least expect some basic wifi connection. When I spoke with the manager all she said was that she could not help and that its not their wifi thats the problem, that its probably the site or my computer. Which is not true due to me being able to access my work and school from my phone using my data and later being able to access it with no issues at another coffee shop. Clearly they don't care about customer experience."

Nour Alsoori,3 months ago, 5 stars ,"Surprisingly some of the best cookies in town. Crispy edges and chewy center like I wish all cookies are. The boxes are cute and not too expensive.

High recommend the cookies and cream and chocolate caramel. The peanut butter one was a bit of a downer."
Hellooo Sunshine,3 months ago, 5 stars ,Hi Flawnson - glad you enjoyed the cookies! And thank you for the tip about the Reese's. Hope to see you again soon!

Thank you kindly for your instrumental support for front line nurses. We truly felt the love through the wonderful treats today! Thank you again for making our nursing week a truly special one. I am confident to say, your location has now gained a massive fanbase of operating room nurses ❤️"
Antonia G,4 months ago, 5 stars ,Hands down best coffee shop! I always come to this shop for a Masala Chai Latte and their cinnamon rolls. They’re staff is always so friendly and patient when you’re ordering. I’ve also order two coffee take-away jugs and the way they prepare everything very top notch! I highly recommend this place if you ever want to treat your office.

Jonathan Chou,5 months ago, 2 stars ,"Got a capuccino with oat milk. It was delicious no complaints about that, however the lady taking my order was not friendly and she was frowning literally. I understand everyone has bad days but this is a customer service job, and apparently this is not only my experience based on the reviews I have read. The other two people working there were very smiley. So i cut down a star because of not feeling welcomed."
aislinn brown,5 months ago, 5 stars ,Absolutely terrible service. Just awful! That's always been the way with this shop. Management needs training so they can train the staff properly. I walked out without getting anything.
Minh Tú Trần,6 months ago, 4 stars ,"(Translated by Google) Very good coffee, even the decaffeinated one. Some milk alternatives to choose from. Lots of sweet pastries and tasty croissants. Not particularly cheap but reasonable for the quality offered

B. Lin,6 months ago, 4 stars ,"Had an iced mocha latte here, it tasted good! my only complaint was that both our paper straws were getting caught in the lid of the cup and it became impossible to move the straw around. But otherwise it was delicious!"
Abby Sky,6 months ago, 5 stars ,"I LOVE This place!!

Their chai tea latte is the best in the city, in my opinion.

Staff is so friendly and their cakes and cookies are delicious.

ABSOLUTELY recommend this and any of their other locations."
Liz Sant,6 months ago, 5 stars ,Odd experience. We stood in front of the counter ready to make our order but neither of the baristas acknowledged us for 5 straight minutes as if we weren’t there. We were confused for people picking up our order but even then a simple hello would’ve been appropriate?The cold brew was mediocre. Not coming back.

Tiffany Santos,8 months ago, 5 stars ,"Their must be a reason why they are always busy.

Must try tiramisu latte.. 2 stars overall"

Kyle Chin,a year ago, 5 stars ,"not sure why this place is so popular, I’m convinced people don’t like real coffee. portion size is way overboard, ordered a medium and it’s even bigger than Starbucks which is bigger than any boutique cafe already. most importantly, the latte tastes like water downed milk. I can’t even taste the espresso…."
Efraim Pestana,a year ago, 5 stars ,"Price: everything is worth it

My experience: I tried the taro latte and wow 🤤 there are so many things I want to try like the red tea latte, matcha and more. The bloomers donuts are beautiful, large and a great option alongside the many fresh baked snacks offered. So happy to have come across this chain and hope to see so many more around Toronto. 100% recommend 💯"

Tammy S,a year ago, 3 stars ,The concept is simpler than ordering at Starbucks which can be confusing at times even on the app. Service is consistently friendly across all locations. This newer location also has Bloomer's vegan donuts which are not cheap but pretty good with unusual flavours. Their teas are frothed with table cream instead of normal cream and the combo is divine with a bit of sweetness.

Tammy Kent,a year ago, 5 stars ,Coffee was okay. The cup literally collaped from the bottom when I pressed to secure the lid.. got coffee all over my hands. Later at home I noticed the cup was dissolving from the inside and I had a few paper bits in my mouth because it had no wax lining.. Its made from the same material inside as outside - how completely bizarre. The staff were super friendly and helpful so 5 starts for that. The staff are aware of the collapsing issue with the cups.

Mavis Li,a year ago, 5 stars ,"Edited: I went back and bought this beautiful Tiramisu vegan donut topped with a luscious  ""marscapone cream cheese"" and dusted with cocoa and a whisper of espresso powder...devine! I attached a picture of the beauty, below....try it, you won't be sorry!

I would have given them 5 stars but, the female behind the counter was not in a good mood...you're in the customer service business try to act like you like your job or at least be nice. When asked where the vegan donuts are don't just point, use your vocal chords. Anyways, the coffee was great; flavourful,  smoky and full of nutty and caramel notes and perfectly bitter. The ""Bloomers"" vegan donuts are amazing! Fluffy but dense and delicious.  I had the maple donut and it was fantabulous! I'd be back for the product but not the service."

They have a wide drink selection and the staff there are very courteous. I go so often that the staff know my coffee preference by heart! And Helen, one of the baristas, makes an effort to memorize every customer's name thus making each interaction very personal which I LOVE!

OHH THEY ALSO SELL BLOOMER DONUTS!!! YA'LL GOTTA GET THERE EARLY BECAUSE THEY SELL OUT SOMETIMES!"

Dr. Camy Grewal,2 years ago, 4 stars ,"There’s always something amiss with this particular Mos Mos shop. Either they tell me Espresso bean only have blonde roast (when they actually have medium roast) or this time, packed me a dark roast coffee bean instead of an espresso bean! Because the packaging was updated, I even asked the staff to checked if the coffee bean was for espresso and the staff told me it was. Please train your staff better on product knowledge so your customer does not have to make multiple trips back for return/exchange!"

Arjun Rudra,2 years ago, 5 stars ,"I had some trouble hearing the cashier so they spoke louder of course, but the overall interaction and attitude just felt very dismissive after that. I just think I visited on an off day for them. I love their drink selection and the variety of options for coffee and tea. The cookies are really delicious and fresh! I also loved how fluffy and big the vegan donut was. Although, I may have gotten the wrong flavour; I let them choose for me, and the one I received had a very tart, strong, sweet, fruitiness to it that just wouldn't sit right with me as I personally enjoy more mellow flavours. I also ordered the mango Chai latte with soy milk. That also didn't really work with me for similar reasons... but I will make another visit very soon and make some safer choices and adjust my review accordingly if the experience improves!"

John McPherson,2 years ago, 5 stars ,"I had a nice experience at Mos Mos. I love the name and the concept behind the brand. Even though the staff experienced an extreme technical issue today, they were welcoming, kind and friendly. I have tried the medium flat white which tasted overly milky.

Leslie L,3 years ago, 5 stars ,"Thank you to Victor, Cecile, Aehee, Aranza, Jaemin, Jenna, and Helen for always making our drinks with a smile on their faces. I go to this location on a weekly basis from work with a huge order and they are always so patient with me. Their selection of drinks and treats are incredible and everything I’ve tried, I’ve loved. It is truly the highlight of my week!"

Amy Truong,3 years ago, 3 stars ,"Easily some of the best chai lattes I've ever had! Lots of cafes with mediocre chai lattes go overboard with the cinnamon or the milk, but the ones here taste very balanced.

I had the cardamom and mango ones and they were both very delicious, with the rich taste of chai permeating the whole drink. I like how there's a complex aftertaste - you can taste the milk, the chai and your flavour of choice.

Note that the sugar level and toppings are adjustable, which is great for a little bit of customization. I personally found half sugar the right amount of sugar.

Also: my pickup order was packed with care and the staff was very friendly. 90% of cafes here don't give me a tray or paper bag unless I ask, but I got both without any prompting. Great service!"

Khyati Vasavada,3 years ago, 5 stars ,"Tried their rosewater/pistachio doughnut and it was delicious. It was large and fluffy, the rosewater flavour comes through but not overpowering. I couldn't tell the difference if it was vegan. Would recommend!"
