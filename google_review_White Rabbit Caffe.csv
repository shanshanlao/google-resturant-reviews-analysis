Anne Mary Pham,2 weeks ago, 5 stars ,"Great coffee and decent vibes. There isn‚Äôt much space to sit/work, so I wouldn‚Äôt come here to study. But this place definitely serves a great flat white!"
Zahra Rajaei,2 weeks ago, 5 stars ,"Small, minimalistic and cute caffe with nice and friendly staff. There are not much sitting spaces but very well designed to have a calming vibe. I also love the menu as it is pretty straight forward and compartmented so you don‚Äôt need to spend half an hour to choose your order.
Their croissants was OK, not the best."
Anne,3 weeks ago, 5 stars ,"Such a cute, minimalistic little caf√© with great coffee and pastries. I loved the pistachio oat milk latte and croissants. All the staff are so nice, you'll feel relaxed and at home here."
Maia Iris,3 weeks ago, 5 stars ,Cute and compact cafe which also sells coffee beans and a small array of pastries. The pistachio latte is fantastic!
Grace David,2 months ago, 4 stars ,"Another overpriced cafe but oh how I love it. A little sad that they only have 3 functional tables so if you are planning to go there to work, don‚Äôt. Or at-least have a backup plan. Tea was good but not worth five dollars. Pastries however, were phenomenal and I thoroughly enjoyed their raspberry croissant.

The atmospheres is really cute and service was quick and kind so I may try to come early to get a table and study for the day, but not to sure if it‚Äôs worth it."
Healani Norman,3 months ago, 4 stars ,"Very minimalistic coffee shop, I love it!!! The menu is easily compartmentalized so you're not spending twenty minutes deciding or even trying to locate what you want. I ordered the latte and my husband got the cappuccino, both of which came out with perfect micro foam. The croissant was on par being light and fluffy. We sat outside at one of the tables out front and people watched for a little while. Very lovely overall :)"
A Dreamer (ASA),3 months ago, 4 stars ,"I don‚Äôt usually go to small cafes like this (I go to big mainstream ones) but coming to this one on a whim at 8AM on a rainy morning was very cathartic. I‚Äôm not in Toronto all the time, so in a dry corner outside I spent 10 mins trying to find a cafe open, as it was 7:30am and many came up and frankly I walked the distance to a few, to which I couldn‚Äôt find and or cafes that didn‚Äôt feel right. When I saw this one I was pulled in b/c the name and honestly I‚Äôm glad I made the walking trip in the cold that morning. I had a version of a green tea White Rabbit Caffe offered & it was very bitter but that‚Äôs green tea for you üòÇ it was a big cup, I spent an hour or so here with my air buds in and I was not bothered. A place to try for the vibes, friends."

Nelly Aguila,3 months ago, 5 stars ,
Jim Wallace,4 months ago, 4 stars ,"Good coffee, but a quite limited selection of pastries and such the day I was there. Nice place, though."
Tyler TM,4 months ago, 4 stars ,"This local coffee shop has some great stuff.  Coffee is really high quality and quite affordable.  It‚Äôs a small little place, so maybe not super idea for working/studying but there‚Äôs room if you need to.  Drink specials can run a bit on the pricier side, so I‚Äôd stick to the classics"
Jessie C,4 months ago, 4 stars ,Small and cozy cafe. Nice ambiance but limited seating. Came in to order matcha latte with oat milk and it tasted great!
Karthik,5 months ago, 5 stars ,
Melissa B,5 months ago, 5 stars ,"I love this little spot. Great to get some work done and have a cappuccino :) Indoor and outdoor seating with good wifi. The cold tea is also good, the barista made me one with lichee and it was delicious."
Kathleene Sim,6 months ago, 5 stars ,"I've been searching for a cafe that opens early in the morning ~7AM on weekdays so I can spend some time having breakfast before I head over to work. I'd always known this caf√© existed but I never took the leap to visit until today, and I'm really glad I took that chance.

The exterior is tiny and unassuming, but when you come in, you're invited into a small, cozy space filled with greenery in the form of decor, and lots of seating. It's a very home-y atmosphere and has this unpolished vibe to it ‚Äì I liked it; it reminded me of a cafe I used to visit while in school.

I ordered a lavender latte and pistachio croissant. The barista was kind and helpful with describing the lavender latte, as I had some concerns. They were also able to sub in oat milk, as I'm a bit lactose intolerant.

I love lavender in theory, but any strong aromas of it truthfully turns me away. The latte I got was like the idea of lavender; the flavour was definitely there, but in a really subtle way, which is how I'd hoped it to be. The pistachio croissant was GREAT. They really didn't skimp on that filling.

I'll be back soon to try the rest of the menu!"
Tiffany Santos,6 months ago, 5 stars ,Highly recommend the lavender and pistachio latte!
Adel B,7 months ago, 1 star ,"Dissapointing experience. The drinks are very watered down, and the lids don't even fit properly so it spills when you try to drink which stained my pants.

In addition, although there are straws, they don't give you them and they don't even fit.

I hope this business improves because it definitely does not deserve over 2 stars..."
F J Iturralde,7 months ago, 5 stars ,"Awesome service. Great presentation. Nice Aesthetics. Good coffee. Good Pastries. If Ethan is in there, you'll have a great service."
Megan Fleming,7 months ago, 3 stars ,"Friendly experience and DELICIOUS iced lavender latte! I was excited to check out this caf√© when I learned it had zero plastic, but it seems their to-go iced drinks cups are not zero plastic. I have been to other caf√©s with to-go iced drink cups that look like plastic but are indeed compostable, but this one has a recyclable symbol. I'd go back for a hot drink or to eat-in, but I was disappointed that their iced drink cups are not plastic-free despite being a zero plastic caf√©."
Ramya Gudipudi,7 months ago, 2 stars ,"Ordered oat latte but had weird after taste for some reason, not sure it‚Äôs with espresso or oat milk. Not interested to visit again!"
Mk Bru,7 months ago, 5 stars ,quality lattes every time. highly skilled baristas. looking forward to my next visit!

Carla C,8 months ago, 4 stars ,"It took me a while to have someone take my order in the store (the barista/cashier was absent), but the coffee is great! Would recommend :)"
Marisa Benjamin,9 months ago, 5 stars ,Best Americano I‚Äôve had! Also their raspberry croissant was excellent. Stop in here if you‚Äôre a coffee purist & make sure to grab one of their many croissant options.
Ryan N,9 months ago, 5 stars ,Great lattes and the baked goods are tasty/not too sweet! The barista was very helpful in deciding what to choose as well

Lavinia Kim,10 months ago, 5 stars ,"The owner makes amazing lattes! Plus he‚Äôs a very warm and friendly person, always makes you feel welcomed. We live nearby and get our coffee from White Rabbit 4-5 times in a week. ‚òïÔ∏è"
Rekha,10 months ago, 5 stars ,"I got an iced mocha, it was delicious!!"
Natalia Marchenko,10 months ago, 1 star ,"The barista has to do a bit of training on the drinks preparation and customer service. Very unhappy to get the extremely diluted Americano on Wednesday.

The place also needs a very good clean. Not sure what the owner tries to achieve with dried-out potted plants and dust everywhere."
Mike Di Donato,10 months ago, 5 stars ,"Best espresso on Bay street. Anytime i am in this area i make a point to stop here and have a coffee, great staff, great atmosphere and amazing espresso."
Peter Shalala,10 months ago, 5 stars ,This is the best coffee shop in Toronto. Latte heaven

Shivaani Makesan,a year ago, 5 stars ,Had the lavender latte. It was sooo good!
Adriana Naffah,a year ago, 5 stars ,"Honestly love the place. Yes the coffee is good. Yes the pastries are delicious and fresh with multiple unique choices.

But what took the 5 stars is how friendly the barista was. It's such a cute place to sit with such a good ambiance. I had recommandations, jokes, a smile and a very friendly voice. That's what made the difference. Would come back ."

Mochi OCk,a year ago, 5 stars ,
Alex Mityunin,a year ago, 5 stars ,Amazing coffee and pastries
Hitesh Thukral,a year ago, 4 stars ,"Above average coffee, decent brew and flavor but not much complexity in milk based drinks (haclvemt tried the espresso or Americano by itself),  great croissants, would like a wider selection of pastries though"
Geoffrey L,a year ago, 5 stars ,"Best coffee on Bay Street. The little pastries are nice but the lattes are just amazing.

They're also super nice people. I forgot to bring my wallet once and the owner offered to give me the coffee for free. I declined came back immediately from my office to pay for it. It's honestly the best caf√© around in my opinion."
„Ç±„Éì„É≥,a year ago, 1 star ,Wrong hours on Google maps
Meggan Ye,a year ago, 5 stars ,Delicious lavender latte and pistachio croissant.
A O,a year ago, 5 stars ,"Cute small Cafe but good amount of indoor and outdoor seats. I always order the lavender latte because it's so good. I haven't had any of the baked goods and the other beverages but the menu looks pretty interesting. Next time,  I'll try something new.  Staff are pleasant as well.

Update:
Pistachio latte is amazing. The croissants are great too!"
Angel Chan,a year ago, 5 stars ,
Alex B,a year ago, 5 stars ,
Christine McMullin,a year ago, 5 stars ,This cafe is awesome! The owner is great and very responsive to anything you said to him about the food or drinks. He and the store itself were some of my fav things about that neighborhood when I lived there. So much better than Timmies. Keep it up!!
Payam Emadi,a year ago, 5 stars ,Nice spot
Adam Schneider,a year ago, 5 stars ,"I‚Äôd give this place 10 stars if I could. For one thing, the espresso was great, and every americano or latte or flat white I got was perfect. For another, the owner (who was most often the person behind the counter when we went in) was a breath of fresh air - one of the few people in the city who was friendly, personable, and treated my wife and me as human beings. He‚Äôd always smile, chat, and he remembered our orders and things we told him. People often talk about ‚Äúlocal gems‚Äù and this place is the dictionary definition of that term. If I hadn‚Äôt left the city, I‚Äôd be there every day."
Nero T,a year ago, 4 stars ,Quant cafe with indoor and outdoor seating. Tasty croissants and coffee. They have milk alternatives for those who prefer
Ncedile Mankahla,a year ago, 5 stars ,"Excellent cafe. The owner understands coffee well and pulls great cups, he is attentive to his customers and their preferences and is pleasantly hospitable. One of the better places in Toronto. A city with an under developed coffee culture."
Tenzo,a year ago, 4 stars ,americano's fairly mild but balanced
Timothy K,a year ago, 2 stars ,"The White Rabb was really missing ""it"" (see photo).

The most disappointing part of this coffee shop was that it has high reviews (4.7) at the time of writing this. In reality this is a 2-3 star coffee shop. The flat white was overly milky and technically a latte -I would say it fell flat. The google listing writes ""sandwiches and salads"" but middle of the day they only had like, 5-6 croissants to chose from and there was a fly on them. If you want to eat, go elsewhere.

Edit: Saw the owner's reply below, unfortunately the review wasn't written the same day as the experience took place so I doubt the ""barista in training"" excuse (also because I only saw one employee on site that day (Tuesday Oct 12th, app. 11:30am) and I'm fairly certain the barista that served us was the owner) and, I do appreciate the offer of a free coffee but we had come to the establishment for the sandwiches and salads, hopefully you guys will have that in the future."
Elida Nexha,a year ago, 5 stars ,"In LOVE with this place and their lavender latte!!!
Just keep in mind that the cafe is a bit small and I‚Äôm not sure if there are any outlets (in case you come to study)."
Swaraj Kashyap,a year ago, 5 stars ,Love the Special Lattes
Max Y,a year ago, 2 stars ,Been here for a couple of times. Lavender latte is so good and is also the main reason I go. Else I‚Äôll definitely choose other coffee shops because of the customer service of the male barista. Whenever I bump into the male barista his attitude somehow just makes you uncomfortable. The female barista is excellent.
Tatiana Farfan,a year ago, 5 stars ,"Loved this place! No rush, it's a soul warming place. Love and respect for each cup of coffee. Fantastic!!"
Jinm H,a year ago, 1 star ,"The coffee is good, but the customer service really bad, the owner is no friendly. Really bad experience, will never go there again."
Izzie Newsome,a year ago, 5 stars ,"Delicious coffee and out-of-this-world donuts! Very cute cafe, too."
K D,a year ago, 5 stars ,"Went here for the first time today and it's a lovely little coffee shop. The owner is very friendly, my latt√© was exceptional and the tea is a high quality loose tea."
Ramy Saboungui,a year ago, 5 stars ,"If you're around and have some time, grab your coffee from here!

A good place for your coffee dose, they make interesting creations and their bakery and brunch items are worth the try.

The ambience is great, especially with a Cappuccino or a Cortado!"
Benjamin-Daniel Tew,a year ago, 5 stars ,
Cassidy Holm,a year ago, 5 stars ,"Was just walking down Bay Street in search for a coffee and stumbled passed this gem. Not from Toronto so never heard of it. Owner is a gem. Knew the customer before me and after me by name, made the most spectacular coffee. Place is very neat and cozy would 11/10 recommend!"

Sruthi Thomas,a year ago, 5 stars ,We got the five dip platter and it was great! But the best part was the proprietor! He's so kind and friendly! Had a great time!
Yun Shen,a year ago, 5 stars ,"I love this place. I've visited from time to time over the past year, and they haven't let me down yet. Espresso was smooth, rich, and ever so slightly tart. It's perfect. Cold brew is also excellent. Pastries are always sold out in the afternoon. I like to order the cheese croissant when they're not sold out, a very tasty treat."
Stephen Tadgh,a year ago, 4 stars ,Took me a while to find somewhere that does a good flat white in the city but these guys didn't let me down! Great little coffee spot for anyone who is looking to branch out from the Tim Hortons and Starbucks!
George Harvey,a year ago, 5 stars ,One of the best places for coffee in the city! Coffee is great! Desserts are decadent and amazing. My friend says ‚Äúdamn good lemonade‚Äù. Been here three times and I have never been disappointed. This will has been my new coffee place since Coffee Public moved.
Sally Chung,a year ago, 5 stars ,Cute little cafe! Loved the interior. Also picked up the last two pastries that were available with my coffee - one was an apple croissant and the other a donut and I didn't regret it!
Andrew Gong,a year ago, 5 stars ,"I take a longer walk to this cafe because of the unique latte flavors that are not usually offered at other cafes, such as pistachio latte. I personally like their patio because though located on Bay Street, there‚Äôs not much foot/car traffic, especially as the sidewalk is wide on this portion of Bay Street. However, the patio is less ideal for patrons who prefer more shading from the sun as there isn‚Äôt much shading for most seats."
David Yazbeck,a year ago, 5 stars ,Fantastic service - and even better coffee!
Michelle Ly,a year ago, 5 stars ,Love their iced apple espresso

Bindu,a year ago, 1 star ,"Places that don't want to serve customers same quality of coffee during a promotion shouldn't participate in them. I was shopping around for a coffee shop that I could frequent, ordered an iced coffee from Ritual and got a watered down, weak drink. Went to Mos Mos just down the road that seems to know the point of promotions: to induce patronage. Which they did successfully. I'll buying my iced coffee and Bloomers' donuts at Mos Mos in the future"

They have a huge variety of various specialty lattes available (I tried the vanilla, and want to get the pistachio next time!) My boyfriend also purchased some of their coffee beans which he was very pleased with as well!"
Ryan W,a year ago, 5 stars ,Super awesome Iced Americano.!!
Leo Twin Flame,a year ago, 5 stars ,"I call this place the diamond caf√© of Toronto. I usually walk 10 min on my break from my office to get their refreshing tea, coffee and lat√©. The service is professional and they are very friendly. Always having a great experience there. I can confidently say, it's one of my best coffee shops in town! You need to try it to know what I'm talking about. I forgot Tim Hortons and Starbucks after discovering this place üëèüëç‚ù§"
Rupica Sudan (DineInToronto),a year ago, 5 stars ,Sucha a cute little spot. The service is fantastic and the coffee is delish!
Sabrina A,a year ago, 5 stars ,"This is the best coffee shop in the area! Every drink I've tried has been amazing (the pistachio latte is definitely my fave), and the owners are always so pleasant and sweet. I try not to go out for my coffee too often, but when I need a treat, White Rabbit is the place to go!"
Eszter Mark√≥,a year ago, 5 stars ,"Had a great experience in White Rabbit Caffe. Currently they‚Äôre offering Brazilian beans for espresso, roasted by Hatch. The barista is friendly, communicative and professional; he took his time to provide an exceptional shot while he was maintaining a conversation with me. I‚Äôm confident that I‚Äôll visit this coffee shop more often. #supportlocal"
Vincent Tse,a year ago, 5 stars ,I‚Äôm no coffee expert but this place deserves all the praise it gets. I highly recommend the pistachio latte and the mocha latte. Has a higher price tag but worth it as this is the best latte I‚Äôve had in a long time.

C,2 years ago, 3 stars ,"Looks like people love this cafe, but most people comment about the flavoured lattes. When it‚Äôs regular latte it‚Äôs super sour to me? Is it just me? Flavoured lattes drinkers won‚Äôt be able to tell as the syrup masks the sourness. But it‚Äôs seriously so sour."

em ily,2 years ago, 1 star ,"The owner of this cafe can be very nice. I have been pre-COVID and he is very keen to engage every one of his customers. That being said, post-COVID I have been semi-terrified by his utter lack of respect for the guidelines. The last five times I have passed by or gone into the store to get something the man has his mask either not covering his nostrils or not covering his mouth at all! I have seen other reviewers mention this behavior and also seen the owner reply with an excuse like ""you came in when the cafe was empty"" but he definitely still does this when plenty of people are in the store. I definitely go less than I did before COVID because of this behaviour. There are plenty of other cafes that are rule-abiding and that have products that are just as good."

William Khalil,2 years ago, 5 stars ,"2020.10.05. Our visit to White Rabbit is becoming a ritual. A great one. All the family loves their coffee ... Hot Americano and Iced Americano. Thank you @snapturethis for the initial recommendation to visit White Rabbit and for the special coffee display of lovely coffee prints by @snapturethis (you should visit the place, try their coffee, and see the prints). We support local businesses. We love coffee.

2020.08.24. Our second coffee of the day was a visit to a favorite coffee place ""White Rabbit Cafe Toronto"". Our family is specialized in coffee tasting. We visit and drink a lot of coffee at many places. This place is a top scorer. Try their coffee you will not regret it. We sat outside and it was very pleasant.  Bravo WRCT."

Toby Whitfield,2 years ago, 3 stars ,"Great coffee, but yikes for COVID risk. This place is tiny, and shouldn't have tables, as those using them are unmasked.

Unfortunately it is good coffee, because I'm not going back to expose myself needlessly."

I could sit here for hours! There is wifi. They are no plastic! They have oatmilk for your drinks for free. The bathroom is super cute too and so clean. A must go in the area!

Update: Owner has added a patio, which is excellent especially during COVID. Wifi reaches table outside (close to window) which is great!"

Dmitry Romanenko,2 years ago, 5 stars ,"Decent coffee, friendly atmosphere, amazing Barista. Coffee beans are having very rich taste that remind me of Black Canary beans. Thumbs up!

I have concerns about quite small space inside. There's probably no point to fit so many tables and chairs inside if you can't let people sit so close in current pandemic realities. This space instead could be reliably used for waiting area."
Chaitanya ‚ÄúChai‚Äù Narula,2 years ago, 5 stars ,"This is my favorite place in the area. First and foremost, the coffee is absolutely amazing and to top it off, the owner sources some top quality baked goodies. The mugs are unprinted, stamped and compostable. He uses organic, really good quality milk and is just a great person to have a quick conversation while the fresh brew is prepared."

Phoenix Kiula,2 years ago, 4 stars ,Excellent coffee. Great to have this as an option to Hailed in the neighborhood. The coffee bean could be fuller bodied. It seems Canadians like their coffee mild. I miss the coffee from Sydney. The barista seems to be the owner too and he‚Äôs a master of the making art: each cup is meticulously made. The blueberry croissant is gorgeous. If the coffee itself was a bit stronger this would be a 5 star in my book.

Ishrat Trishna,2 years ago, 5 stars ,"This is an exceptional little cafe! The cozy and welcoming decor is what drew me in on a grey, windy day. The owner is fun to chat with and the drinks were phenomenal. I had a latte and my husband had a hit chocolate and both were top notch! I'm so excited to be a patron here hopefully for a long time to come."
Pranay Garg,2 years ago, 5 stars ,"White rabbit is the place to be! I love the coffee here. Amazing coffee, fresh ingredients. Unlike many popular chains the shop uses real ground coffee instead of chocolate syrups for mocha and it has quickly become my favourite. I have also grown a liking to pistachio latte, a coffee with notes of pistachio mixed in latte and a wonderful aftertaste. Wether you need your daily coffee fix or looking to elevate your experience of drinking coffee, white rabbit is your place!"

Sergei Makarov,3 years ago, 4 stars ,"Please either change your hours or don't close 15 minutes earlier. I went to your place at 19:45 today and the barista was already closing the cafe because ""there were no clients for the last hour"". Two other people arrived at the same time and also were turned away. Very frustrating experience.
Otherwise the place is great, pastries are especially good."

Rebecca Wilkinson,3 years ago, 5 stars ,Super cute little cafe on Bay street that serves up 10/10 espressos and great pastries (the pistachio croissants are especially amazing). They also serve a bunch of vegan or vegetarian options for lunch like veggie bowls and sandwiches. It's a nicely designed and cozy spot to sit down and hang out in if you are in the area.
