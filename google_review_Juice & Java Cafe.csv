Juice & Java Cafe,Queen St E,Courtney Ayukawa,a month ago, 3 stars ,"Vibe and atmosphere is cute and cozy with a good amount of seating upstairs.

I think they recently increased their prices and the menu on their website might be out of date.
I don't feel like what I got was worth it. After tax and 15% tip, my club sandwich and side minestrone soup was $26. Inflation hitting hard!

Very few options for people who are lactose intolerant or vegan as nearly all menu items have cheese."
Juice & Java Cafe,Queen St E,paul booi,a month ago, 5 stars ,One of the best places in the beach
Juice & Java Cafe,Queen St E,Rhiannon B,3 months ago, 1 star ,"They don‚Äôt pay their employees if they don‚Äôt have to, apparently (I opened a labour board dispute and won and they STILL didn‚Äôt pay me, a former employee came in when I was working there and said they did her dirty as well as another review here has another employee saying the same)‚Ä¶they also bought pastries from a local cafe/pie place (now closed) and repeatedly froze & thawed them out to sell at full price as a daily business practice - one of many cut corners. I wouldn‚Äôt eat any of the food. If you‚Äôre disabled, green or naive definitely keep on looking for a job, it‚Äôs not worth it - this couple will be mean to you and/or take advantage."
Juice & Java Cafe,Queen St E,Maliha K.,3 months ago, 3 stars ,"Not too bad, if I‚Äôm being honest not my FAVOURITE coffee shop on the beaches because I feel like the coffee is sometimes not fresh and the matcha drinks are 98% milk and 2% matcha. I do however love the service and their baked stuff, brownies and cookies are great here!! If you‚Äôre looking to get their salads though I would probably not.. there‚Äôs better salad other places around. Great customer service though, super friendly people, just not too good for their actual drinks :( Not worth the price, sorry!!"
Juice & Java Cafe,Queen St E,Jim W,3 months ago, 3 stars ,It's fine. Been here twice and the food is not worth the price but it was fine. The crepe menu looks good but the sandwich board is approaching fine dining prices for basic sandwiches. It seems to be busy with an older local clientele. The way their stock is stored is quite odd. It was very clean but cluttered in layout.
Juice & Java Cafe,Queen St E,Eri Maeda,4 months ago, 5 stars ,The prices on the menu are increase and no longer matching on their website but still the best crapes on the Beach!
Juice & Java Cafe,Queen St E,Fiona e,4 months ago, 1 star ,Horrible woman. I was told to ‚Äúnot move around and sit down‚Äù after I went upstairs to look around and connect to the wifi. Also their bagels are half the size of regular bagels and they are charging 5$ more then the bagel place in my neighbourhood Yonge and Eglinton.
Juice & Java Cafe,Queen St E,Kara Beharry,5 months ago, 5 stars ,"Really enjoyed my experience at this Cafe. The name is misleading as they offer lots of food items. Oh well, after a 30km bike ride my appetite was definitely satiated with one of their savory crepe, hot sandwich, and delicious chai tea latte. Huge shout-out for making that great cup of chai. It was yum-o! Will definitely come back."

We came to the place right before they were closing and ordered 1 cup of americano and 1 cappuccino, paid $10 for the order and americano was beyond disgusting! They were rushing to close at 4:40 and felt like they didn‚Äôt change the coffee from the previous client and made this ‚Äúbrown water‚Äù for my order. I couldn‚Äôt drink this absolutely gross ‚Äúdrink‚Äù and had to just poor it out! üëéüèª"

Juice & Java Cafe,Queen St E,Olivia Morgan,a year ago, 1 star ,Staff is not friendly & coffee is overrated. I dropped my coffee in the store after I paid $7.00 for a coffee and I tipped.

First time, we ordered the stuffed peppers with meat to take home - and oh my gosh so yummy and full of flavor. Second time, ordered the Cubano sandwich and the smoked salmon crepe. The Cubano is perfect, very yummy and the crepe is well balanced with smoked salmon, cream cheese, onion and capers. Definitely will be back to try other items. They‚Äôre also very nice people. Thank you so much!"

Food is mediocre and coffee is average. Most importantly, the service is horrible! I live in the area and would occasionally frequent this cafe. I would always be greeted with a stern frown for a greeting.

There are better options in this area, and better choices  when it comes to food, drink, and service."
Juice & Java Cafe,Queen St E,Aya Hachicho,3 years ago, 4 stars ,"This place is actually really great in the winter! It‚Äôs very cozy. Their mocha was good.

I also ordered a vege delight crepe, it was ok but I wish it had more flavor. The sauce was on the side and would have preferred it on the inside to add some taste to the veges"

Juice & Java Cafe,Queen St E,Trina Szkut,3 years ago, 3 stars ,"There areonly a few breakfast place to try on this side of Queens street. We woke up late from a trip and it was pass 11 AM  finding a breakfast place to eat. We want to enjoy the place where we could feel we were in The Beaches area and would not like to eat in a fast food joint and found  Juice & Java. Big seating area in/out,The food was good for breakfast,service is average, self service except for  food was delivered to our table. Pricing I think is somewhat high for the food and service offered."
Juice & Java Cafe,Queen St E,Nicole N,3 years ago, 5 stars ,"Quality food for a reasonable price in a cute spot, great for coffee catch-ups with friends or even small business meetings.

Juice & Java Cafe,Queen St E,Van Nguyen,3 years ago, 2 stars ,"Long wait time and not as described.

I ordered a loose leaf iced tea asking for it to be unsweetened and they claimed their drinks didn‚Äôt have added sweeteners... which it did.

The drink itself tasted fine and I don‚Äôt like to post negative reviews for independent owned shops... but the Nutella crepe was disgustingly sweet and the strawberries were not fresh. I thought it would be fresh considering it was a $10 crepe - but I can tell when it‚Äôs defrosted frozen strawberries. Because of the strawberries, I had to write a review to let others manage their expectations.

Also if management is reading this, you need to go easy on the Nutella."

But the worst thing was the worst grilled cheese any in my party had ever had ... tasted like cardboard. And then there's that smiley face created with ketchup. It's not charming, Juice & Java. It's silly. And given the price you charged for it, a pickle or a bit of coleslaw on the side would have made up for the bland cheese. I wish I knew what cheese that was, so I'll remember never to buy it..  And to top it off,  you served it in a cereal bowl. Really?"

Juice & Java Cafe,Queen St E,Ronak Dhanak,4 years ago, 5 stars ,The coffee here tastes different than most of the other coffee shops.. probably the beans that they use. I found the coffee stronger yet subtle and more earthy. Along with the  coffee we had the vegetable sandwich (rye bread) and the carrot muffin. The sandwich was extremely fresh and the bread was good..but what needs to be commended is the carrot muffin- absolutely delicious. The place is spacious with a wonderful team and even has a little library of its own. An excellent  choice to sit back and let the weariness dissolve!

I also had an iced hazelnut vanilla coffee. They offer their coffees and teas as hot or iced for same price. Looking at their extensive menu on the wall, they also serve crepes, omelets, sandwiches, and some other standard baked goods which are all baked from scratch in store."

Good quality and good value. You won't be disappointed. Internet wasn't working, can't tell you if it was a random thing. The heat was definitely not working well. The place had some space heaters but it was quite cold. Again, I'm not sure if it was a random thing or just the norm. It was quite uncomfortable, and since the number of space heaters I suspect it was not so random. There was ice on the inside of the window. Perhaps I was just out of luck."

The smoothies are made with real fruits and no sugar added which is good. Their crepes are really well done topped with your choice of toppings. The Italian wedding soup is great.

The coffee is decent, although tends to be on the weaker side.

The upper level is comfortable and has a spacious yet cozy vibe.

Stop in for lunch - you won't be disappointed."

Juice & Java Cafe,Queen St E,Monica Holboke,6 years ago, 1 star ,"Terrible food and service - don't bother.
You need to ask multiple times to get your drinks and then they still may not bring them."
Juice & Java Cafe,Queen St E,Dario E.,7 years ago, 1 star ,"Wanted to like this place because of the atmosphere (it's cozy which is the only plus), however, on several occasions that I have come here they have been out of basic ingredients - juices, breads, milks. The staff are also very forgetful -had to remind them a few times of my order and that I was waiting. Today I ordered my first ""meal"". 9$ (plus tip). For the sandwich, they used the last bottom pieces of the bread (you know the tiny pieces at the front and end of a loaf of bread?) and gave me 4 pieces saying they were mini sandwiches. Not to mention they were over toasted/slightly burnt to the point where biting down to them cut my gums. I literally could have made this sandwich at home for less than I paid. It's really a shame because the atmosphere is nice but that does not excuse them from delivering good food. it just is not somewhere I would ever recommend a friend to go to if they wanted a decent sandwich... or smoothie apparently (refer to the other 1 star review)."
Juice & Java Cafe,Queen St E,Kirsten Visima,7 years ago, 1 star ,"Worst smoothie ever! I asked for a Berry Mango smoothie with almond milk and I got a very weak tasting drink with barely any fruit and extremely pail in colour.  I had trouble believing any berries were even used because the drink was so pale. Last time I checked strawberries were RED and mangos are ORANGE so why was my smoothie almost colourless??? I quickly came back with my smoothie to complain, and  the response I got from the guy behind the counter was so disappointing. He shrugged his shoulders and said ""sorry"". Claimed he put berries in it and that was the end of the conversation. Didn't do anything to rectify the situation. For the hefty price that it cost, (PLUS TIP!!!) I was expecting a whole lot better of a response. Hell, a scoop of berries would have been enough. Worst customer service ever. Will never go back."

Juice & Java Cafe,Queen St E,Eric FREMONT,8 years ago, 4 stars ,"(Translated by Google) A practical and quiet place to eat pancakes or a sandwich. The reception is correct and there is a good value for money.

(Original)
Un endroit pratique et calme pour manger des galettes ou un sandwich. L'accueil est correct et il y a un bon rapport qualit√© prix."
Juice & Java Cafe,Queen St E,Joe Bala,8 years ago, 5 stars ,"Great food, excellent service.  They are always very accommodating.  Great place to bring kids with the library and lots of space."
Juice & Java Cafe,Queen St E,Murray ElHam,9 years ago, 5 stars ,"Service is slow, but the little patio space is nice and the upstairs seating area is great for a quiet weekend afternoon with a book.  The crepes are freakin GOOD!  While everywhere else has a lineup at brunch time, take your s.o. here and enjoy."
Juice & Java Cafe,Queen St E,sergio alberto mendoza,9 years ago, 1 star ,Poor service. My friend and I were the only ones in the place but they seemed in a rush or something to get rid of us. The juice wasn't anything special either. Wouldn't recommend it or come back again.
Juice & Java Cafe,Queen St E,SeA LeGs,9 years ago, 1 star ,"DON'T WORK FOR JUICE AND JAVA!!!! They won't give you your last paychecks, they won't send you your Record of Employment. Working for them was the worst experience I've ever had in my entire life, you will NEVER get your debit tips on time, because their employees are always lowest priority. CRAIG MCCALLUM IS A THIEF, A LIAR AND LACKS COMPLETE INTEGRITY. HE WILL LIE TO ANYONE'S FACE TO PROTECT HIS BEHIND. HE IS ALL TALK AND WHEN IT COMES TO FACING THE MUSIC, HE RUNS AWAY LIKE A LITTLE COCKROACH. I DON'T KNOW HOW HE LIVES WITH HIMSELF EVERY DAY. SAVE YOURSELF THE STRESS AND BAD VIBES AND STAY AWAY FROM THAT PLACE AND STAY AWAY FROM THAT MAN."
