Wacha Chaka,a week ago, 4 stars ,
Allan Pulker,a month ago, 3 stars ,"Not as good as it used to be. Plastic panels between customers and barista, cramped indoor seating and main seating area has been taken over by business-related activities.

However the espresso is still excellent!

It is, alas, no longer my first choice among the various caf√©s in my neighbourhood."
Gabriela,a month ago, 5 stars ,Hands down the best cortado I've ever had! Happy to see gluten free options available! Grabbed a gluten free brownie and it was not very sweet.
Yeung Stephenie,2 months ago, 1 star ,"I ordered a cup of soy milk latte and a cup of earl grey tea, the girl ended up giving me a cup of earl grey tea with soy milk."
Abjith,2 months ago, 5 stars ,
Simon W,3 months ago, 3 stars ,"I would pass by and notice a sign advertising they had ice cream so I decided to give it a try. I'm sure the coffee is great given the reviews, but their ice cream cone was very sad. Would not recommend their ice cream."

Toronto Psychology,6 months ago, 5 stars ,Love the fresh Pastries
Rekha,6 months ago, 2 stars ,"It's okay, nothing special at all. Also, me and three other friends got the exact same drink with no modifications and were somehow charged different amounts before tip. Will not be returning."
R H,6 months ago, 3 stars ,Can‚Äôt beat fresh pastries with a double shot
Andy Dabydeen,6 months ago, 5 stars ,"Excellent coffee shop and roaster. Yes, they have teas and lots of tasty baked goods as well."
Amin Rahmani,7 months ago, 5 stars ,"This was the right place to walk into.
The friendly gent brewing the bean made such a good Americano, I had to stay and have another. Second one was iced since it was so hot out, perfect.
I mentioned to him how I liked that it wasn‚Äôt very acidic, and he pointed out some of the reasons behind it, which were very cool to learn.
Followed that up with the mixed berry muffin I had been eyeing earlier. It had a PROPER amount of berries, which is just the way I like it.
Even managed to get a good amount of work and reading done while listening to the very chill jazz playing in the background.
I‚Äôll definitely make this a regular hangout on my days in town. There are two more muffins I‚Äôm eyeing for my next visit :D"
smriti Khanna,7 months ago, 5 stars ,It was the best coffee i have had in Toronto so far. Strong and refreshing!
Satarupa,7 months ago, 4 stars ,"Had a really good glass of their Ethiopian Cold Brew with notes of Chocolate and Caramel, was refreshing and strong at the same time.
Enjoyed it with a Butter Tart(without raisins), the filling was a tad too sweet for my taste but fresh and good quality.
Overall, would surely revisit to try their other remarkable bean coffees :)"
Elham Yaesubi,8 months ago, 5 stars ,I like this place. The products are really delicious and they're all really fresh
Jerry Higgins,9 months ago, 5 stars ,I feel they are one of the best places to buy roasted coffee beans in Toronto. Good selection of beans  and roasts available. Their beans are my go to for the Aeropress. Food is also great. Service at this location is impeccable and staff here are very friendly.
Alejandra,10 months ago, 2 stars ,"Out of all the pretentious Queen street coffee shops this is one I would urge you not to go here.

I‚Äôve been here several times in the last couple of months because I wanted to give them a chance but nope, still the same awful service every time.

I was just there and the person serving me clearly had no interest in being there and shows no service etiquette. My standards are not high, but all I‚Äôm saying is I‚Äôve received better service at Burger King.

I give them 2/5 because at the very least they have a good selection of food which most coffee shops nowadays don‚Äôt seem to offer.

I would be happy to come back to this Queen staple if their staff integrated manners into work ethic and accepting cash would be a plus!"
Doyour Part,10 months ago, 5 stars ,"Exceptional coffee, service and tarts! Great atmosphere and vibes"
Rob Norris,11 months ago, 5 stars ,Such a cool place for coffee of snack or baked goods!
M T,a year ago, 5 stars ,"Good espresso at a reasonable price. Strong with a smooth ending. Decor was rustic. Barista was pleasant. Many options for pastries and dessert. Had a peanut butter cookie...one of the best, it was 1 inch thick! Hard to choose only one item for a treat. Many options for alternatives other than coffee and cookie."
dan lendvay,a year ago, 5 stars ,"Fantastic shop...great service..OHHHHHHMG delicious pastries....wonderful decor...so unique...forget the chain shops if you live in the area or are passing by...

Stop in...I regret the past years being around and not trying this place sooner!!"

M Sorkhabi,a year ago, 4 stars ,"Friendly staff, good coffee, ok pastry. Prime location: Right on the beach. Doesn‚Äôt have indoor seating but there are a few bistro sets outside; you can also get your coffee to go, enjoy it on the beach. They have loose leaf tea and coffee beans for purchase.
I tried the shortbread cookies; they are thin and taste ok. I wouldn‚Äôt get it again, but the coffee yes!"

Quiet City Design,a year ago, 5 stars ,"I don't get to the east side of Toronto to often, so I don't know the local shops as well. I popped into Remarkable Beam on a whim to pick up coffees for a client meeting. George (owner) was very friendly and accommodating. The coffee is great, and the homemade muffins are a great way to start the day. I'll be back next time I'm in the area!"
Christina Garner,a year ago, 5 stars ,"Not only is this the BEST coffee in the area, the customer service is friendly, familiar and welcoming. Their treats are fresh and delicious and they‚Äôre serious about the quality of their coffee beans. Would highly recommend."

Tanya Stander,3 years ago, 5 stars ,I have been drinking El Zipa coffee from the Remarkable Bean for about 4 years now and I can honestly say this is still my favourite coffee in Toronto (and beyond)! I‚Äôve never had a bad bag of coffee and everyone who drinks it comments how incredibly delicious it is. We just use it in a pour over and it works every time. Delicious! What a joy it is to receive a fresh bag of this coffee delivered to my door every week!!! Keep up the beautiful roast guys!!!

Nancy Macedo,3 years ago, 3 stars ,"Parking was tough to visit the Remarkable Bean. Our decision to still make attempts to stop and enjoy the coffee were based on other reviews and how highly other thought about the place. I found it really average. The place is cute and you can find seating but its awkward at times. I think the owner needs to review seating arrangements - there are definately ways to maximize space without compromising a cozy atmosphere. The coffee was good but was average. I got the rocket fuel coffee and a oatmeal cookie - just average and nothing else to write about. My guess is that its a good  neighborhood spot as it became a bit busy with 1 served who managed drinks, orders, and cash. However, I don't think I'll go out of my way again."

Julian Sammy,4 years ago, 5 stars ,"The man behind the counter, out of the goodness of his heart, made me a little cup of tea as I was leaving. He'd heard me coughing earlier. That was on top of excellent coffe in a spacious, well maintained store. Oh - and the smell of roasting coffee in there and on the street? Amazing."

James O'Hara,4 years ago, 5 stars ,
Sydney Westgate,4 years ago, 5 stars ,"My family and I are frequent customers at the Bean both in Leslieville and the Beaches. Not only is the coffee AMAZING (they roast their own btw) but the desserts are delicious. I suggest trying the ButterTart, they are the best in town! They also have a wide range of gluten free products and some vegan which is nice to have :)

As I said before, the coffee is wonderful. The owner's, as well as one very charming barista with a mighty fine beard, roast their own beans in house. The coffee is strong, not acidic and smooth. Rocket Fuel is my go-to! The espresso is creamy with caramel undertones. Just by the taste of your drink, you know the roasting is done expertly and the staff are well trained when it come's to steaming milk and pouring espresso shots. The staff are also extremely friendly and quirky - don't let the sometimes sarcastic wit steer you away! The Remarkable Bean is certainly unique and the staff are no different. There is jazz music playing in the background and velvet purple, yellow and red pillows.

Everyone who goes to the Bean is also kind. You can certainly tell that in the Leslieville location, almost everyone is a regular and the owners are familiar with many of their customers. Speaking of the owners, the Bean is a family run company and if you are grabbing a coffee from either location you are bound to see them. They care about their store, their customers and their staff. They are, in my opinion, a very ""hallmark"" type of family and if you know hallmark, that means they are kind, charming and passionate about what they do.

If I was going to recommend a coffee shop in Toronto to someone, my first suggestion is always the Remarkable Bean! It may be located outside of the downtown core, but it's worth the trip! My family doesn't live in the area but still choose to swing by the bean when in need of a coffee-fix. Trust me when I say you can't go wrong :)

ALSO they have comedy on friday nights!! BONUS"
jeremy yaksich,4 years ago, 5 stars ,Comedy night every Friday! Can't miss! And free of charge. Awesome.

nicol cotton,4 years ago, 5 stars ,"good coffee and homemade snacks, nice vibe too."
Lara Saliba,4 years ago, 4 stars ,"A great cafe! It's a cute, cozy small design that draws you in and encourages you to settle in and set up shop with a good book or your laptop for a few hours. It's snug, warm, and the wood features and exposed brick wall add a nice style to the place. What stood out the most to me at this shop was the warm atmosphere and the friendliness - not only of the staff, but also of the other patrons! I got excited when I saw it as I thought the name was very adorable, and wanted to take a picture in front of it - I tried to be quick and not block anyone's way but people were also so nice and understanding!"

Thing is, there's like 3 coffee shops within 2mn walk from this place that look all equally good. So while I gave it 4 stars, I'm not sure it really deserves it."

Coffee is good however and there's usually free samples if you can take the wisecracks that come with. Review one year later: offending person no longer employed it seems. Attended excellent comedy event here.

Priscilla Mak,6 years ago, 4 stars ,"Best coffee in Leslieville- I always buy some for housewarming gifts wherever I go and people are really impressed! Great staff, awesome treats. Wouldn't recommend it for sitting and reading or working/studying however- the music is consistently awful, never changed (I've heard the same group of old CDs repeat 3 times in one afternoon type of thing) and volume is set very loud. I bring my noise cancelling headphones and try and make-do because I love the place so much lol"

Chris Brown,6 years ago, 5 stars ,"Glad to see a RB open up closer to me (not a huge fan of the one in the Beaches).
2 experiences here:
One during this past winter; the staff was excellent, friendly and made a great coffee! we had lattes and sausage rolls to refuel after a long (and cold) run. We were able to find a seat even though it was busy.
One during this past summer; Iced tea was really good (they brew it as you order) but the staff seemed to be new and a bit unsure of them self. The drinks took a long time."

Peter Fung,7 years ago, 5 stars ,"Great service, great iced coffee. The day we were there was a pretty slow day so the comedian behind the counter was keeping the spirits light and entertaining us. He made a damn good iced coffee as well. We tried some sweets; a brownie and butter tart, and although the butter tart was a bit too dry the brownie was great. We went to the back patio which was empty to our surprise, on such a nice day. Would go here again!"
