The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Jason G,a month ago, 3 stars ,A nice diner in the beach. Not much to be said about the atmosphere but you will get a decent meal at a reasonable price
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Shane Kennedy,a month ago, 4 stars ,Nice spot for a quick bite to eat. I got the all day breakfast and it was ok. Nothing special but enjoyable. The staff are very nice and the prices are ok for Toronto. Would visit again but wouldn't get the all day breakfast again.

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Nikolas Koschany,a month ago, 3 stars ,"It pains me to leave this review, as the Beacher Cafe is a neighbourhood institution. However, the last time we were here, the service took forever (we learned there was only one cook in the kitchen) and the food took forever to arrive and was sadly mediocre.

This does not have to be fatal, but the restaurant needs to make some improvements to regain our trust."
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Sandra Riley,2 months ago, 4 stars ,Food was ok. They didn't make my eggs right. A bit over-priced in my opinion. Loved the atmosphere

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,K M,2 months ago, 5 stars ,"Had a great breakfast with my daughter, really nice vibe and menu.  The burger was solid but my daughter doesn‚Äôt do toppings so just mind that in the photos.

The only downside is that by the time brunch was done, I was  questioning my Toronto choices in life and consumed with the idea of fleeing midtown, moving out to the beaches, meeting my new neighbours and knowing their names.  Great spot but be careful."

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Farah Arsbi,3 months ago, 2 stars ,Honestly the extra star is only because our server was so nice and welcoming but the food was a complete waste of money. We got the char-grilled chicken burger and the banquet burger and they were both tasteless and so soggy that the bun fell apart.

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Susan Sykas,7 months ago, 5 stars ,Great all day breakfast. Healthy options.
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,David Jonker,7 months ago, 4 stars ,One of favourite brunch spots in the beach over the years. Great for families with younger kids. Often busy on the weekends but their service is relatively quick and they have a lot of tables so it‚Äôs rare to have to wait  a long time to be seated.

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Amanda-Ellen Gibbs,8 months ago, 5 stars ,"Best eggs Benny in the city. Nichelle who works there is a doll and looks after everyone so attentively and kindly. I‚Äôve been going to the Beacher since I was 11 at St.Denis, its never changed (in the best way possible!!). And please never do!"
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Ryan Magder,8 months ago, 2 stars ,"Stopped by for Father's day around 10am.  Sign outside the restaurant mentioned a 25-minute wait for food, no problem, we continued on in and got a table with no issue. After ordering we waited an hour for food. Food arrived cold (eggs, bacon, sausages, potatoes), we ate it because we were starving at that point, understanding that if we sent it back we would likely be waiting a long time for the food to return.

Manager (we assume, she is decision maker for hiring) asks how the food was. Gave her our honest feedback about the long wait and food quality, I'm honestly not sure how the food could arrive cold unless it was sitting at the window for a while. For what it's worth, the service was good and we were able to get refills on our drinks (2nd star for service).

I understand restaurants being understaffed (sure, it happens!), but I'd rather that they communicate it realistically beforehand (i.e., write on the sign out front the wait for food is 45 minutes - 1 hour). We heard other nearby tables with small children asking about the arrival of their food. We were told they'd give it 200% next time, no amendments to the bill were made. Sorry, there will probably not be a next time."

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,V Brown,8 months ago, 5 stars ,
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Jonathan Doyle,8 months ago, 1 star ,"Potatoes weren't seasoned
Eggs and toast were cold
Sausages cooked so long the skin was leathery.

The very friendly server asked how the meal was. I told her the above information.  She brought my bill at full price...which...fine, I did eat most of it and I still tipped 15% because as I said to her...not your fault, these things happen.

I was fine to leave it at that and not review but I asked for a refill on my coffee in a to go cup and after paying for my bad meal in full, she told she would have to ring up a new coffee.

I told her not to bother and would tell anyone reading this also not to bother.

Really disappointing"
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,littleyirkie,8 months ago, 4 stars ,"Good spot, good times."
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Michael Loyst,8 months ago, 2 stars ,"Really disappointed. $15 breakfast and this is the portion they give for bacon. That was after waiting nearly 30 minutes for food. Eggs were delicious, bacon was clearly a low sodium version and tasteless."
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Derek Lamers,9 months ago, 5 stars ,One of my families go to brunch locations. Always great breakfast food and very kid friendly. I will continue coming here for brunch when I'm in the beaches!
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Michael cross,9 months ago, 5 stars ,"Great staff, great food highly recommend"
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Breanne Marie Peacock,9 months ago, 5 stars ,"I love The Beacher Cafe. Growing up in the Beaches, I went here often with friends and family. I stopped by on Victoria Day to show some family outside of Toronto the Beaches. We sat on the patio to enjoy desserts and coffees. Namely, we really enjoyed the cr√®me br√ªl√©e and cheese cake. The service was very friendly. I would always recommend someone to stop by. If you‚Äôre looking for breakfast or brunch, my personal favourites are the eggs Benedict and their big traditional breakfast."

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,John Andrews,9 months ago, 1 star ,"I've been going to The Beacher for some time but the last couple of visits there have been sub par. The interior in winter months tends to be below room temperature, but more than that, the portions have become noticeably smaller, particularly the home fries with the eggs benedict - easily half the size the order was previously. The past two times have been bad experiences. One we waited almost an hour for our food which was also disappointing and yesterday, May 20, we tried again and my wife's omelette was stone cold, as were her home fries. We complained the the waitress took it back to the kitchen and when it returned, yes it was hot but flavourless. She said the best tasting part of her meal was the toast. That's it Beacher... we're done. Never coming back... lots of other places in the Beach that would be happy to have our business and give us value for money. AVOID"
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,kaeli,9 months ago, 1 star ,"Service took forever , food was undercooked, bland and honestly not worth the wait."
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Timothy Ho,9 months ago, 3 stars ,"Servers were friendly and efficient. The food was nothing exceptional but fair. Was a bit concerned when I heard somebody‚ÄîI assume the owner‚Äîscolding one of the servers for doing something incorrectly.

The bill was also a bit of a surprise with their made up ‚ÄúInflation‚Äù tax. Mixed feelings about this considering their prices were already a bit high for what we got.

Overall, great service, food ok."
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Justin Aubut,9 months ago, 5 stars ,I made and delivered 2 picnic tables for this restaurant and the owner gave me and my son free lunch. It was without a doubt the best brie burger I have ever had! Definitely going to take the whole family next time. Thanks Peter!

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Teresa Zhang,9 months ago, 5 stars ,"Hey Bleacher Cafe, went there today, and loved the food as per usual, great atmosphere, however I have noticed an extra ""inflation"" charge on the bills.  I totally get it, with current economic environment and inflation on everything, it is necessary to charge clients the extra amount to ensure your restaurant's survival.  However the only suggestion is perhaps to make a note on the menu stating the % charged to stay a float or have your friendly waiting staff to inform the table. I would be happy to pay for it, it just came to me on my bill as a surprise a had no idea how much was being charged.  Other than that, I am happy to be a patron again at your establishment, b/c I love that quiche you served today.  Thank you!! Would be happy to join the restaurant again soon!"

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Emily Robertson,9 months ago, 2 stars ,"Came for my partners birthday for a quick brunch and was definitely a bit of a subpar experience.

Food was alright but not great for the price. Eggs in my order were made incorrectly, and I had to send them back sadly. The home fries are huge chunks of soft potato, some not even cut. The bacon and eggs were extremely oily‚Ä¶ a bit disappointing.

Our server was nice, and tried to be as accommodating as possible, but she seemed really frazzled. She had to drag around a huge sandwich board with the specials with her all over the restaurant? We felt bad she had to do that just to tell us the specials‚Ä¶ ??

Lastly a few feet away from us on a table in our section was a huge box of cat litter‚Ä¶ so strange. Definitely weird to have out during brunch service."

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Bran Thayalaseelan,10 months ago, 2 stars ,"This place should exist under different ownership or management. A breakfast diner of this sort is much needed in the neighborhood but not one that is as poorly managed.
I guess I'm viewing this more as a restaurant entrepreneur than a patron. The food program is actually not terrible so that's why they don't receive a 1 star review from me (which I so badly want to give)."

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Justin Liberman,11 months ago, 5 stars ,"There are Diners and there are breakfast places. Breakfast places add a little something extra that makes the food tastier, surrounding cozier, and service a notch friendlier. Beacher's Cafe is a great breakfast place with a healthy menu great variety. Go for the eggs Benedict!!"
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Patrick Hodgson,11 months ago, 4 stars ,We've been to The Beacher Cafe several times now and it never disappoints.

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Frederick Hannah,a year ago, 5 stars ,"It took almost an hour to bring our brunch (poached eggs and a quiche), the quality of the food was below average, the waitress first gave us a lecture about how the refill coffee we got (which tasted awful) was by accident as they don't do free refills. When we finally received our order it was the wrong order (another table), then when our order came I had the wrong side... And their prices are a bit too much for a brunch place. Not going back for sure."

We were treated like gold and given a prime table: my mothers special order was not a problem. They answered all our questions about the menu and food came fresh, hot, and plentiful. I enjoyed the Eggs Benjamin. My family were enthusiastic about the fries (crispy and creamy inside) and the cajun chicken caesar. I highly recommend this Beach landmark"

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Tarzanamann,a year ago, 4 stars ,"Used to go here alot many years ago, and wanted to try it again. Very disappointed that they have no vegan options at all, and only two vegetarian options (one of which is an overpriced, basic grilled cheese). It would be so easy to offer all their burgers with the option of a veggie burger patty instead, and then they'd have several more vegetarian options at least. Or even a breakfast option that didn't include meat. I know you can get the current options without meat, but you're still paying for it."

We waited well over an hour for our meal to arrive. We were told that the steak was taking a while to cook. We were told that the BLT on a croissant would have to be on bread because they ran out of croissants. This was about 40 minutes after we had ordered it. People who arrived after us were being served long before us and several had even paid and left while we were waiting for our food. We were presented with bills that were full price. When we said we would not pay the full amount after waiting so long, we were brought bills that were 25% off. We asked to speak to a manager but we‚Äôre told no manager was working that day. We will not be returning which is hard because we know how much people are counting on getting back to normal"

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Cynthia ‚ÄúRealtorCynthia5‚Äù Payne,2 years ago, 2 stars ,"One thing that really stands out for us here for us is the quality of care from the owner and our favourite server Ashley (she is some kind of wonderful).  We will never forget when we first moved in the neighbourhood, this is the first place we went to and in excitement in sharing that we just bought our new home, the owner treated our entire family to ice cream and said ""welcome to the neighbourhood.""  The small gesture meant so much to us as it was so genuine. Over the years, as our child was born we always felt so welcomed there and Ashely (our favourite server) had such a warm, natural rapport with our little guy and as he grew older in his tots they would always wave to eachother as they passed by. We really appreciate the community feels you create for your customers. To us you are family! Thank you for your excellence in customer service and your kindness."
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Quad Mods FPV,2 years ago, 5 stars ,"Have enjoyed many breakfasts at the Beacher Cafe but have recently noticed that although the price of the menu stays the same, but the qualitty of the meals have not.  Especially the Healthy Breakfast that included a choice of avocado or cottage cheese.  The last 3 times we have been at the Beacher Cafe to support the local businesses, we have been told that the avocado is no longer available.  If the avocado is no longer available, then the price should either be lower or offer an additional poached egg.  That's my opinion!"

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Craig Arnold,2 years ago, 5 stars ,"Food is not bad, about what you‚Äôd expect for a cafe.

Then another waitress came and told me that was unacceptable and to move the bike."

The coffee, there's something about simple black coffee that's so good when it's done well!.

We are happy! I think we found a good breakfast place we'd go to once every month or so!

.
The food was great. We tried the all day breakfast, avocado egg benedict special, chocolate mousse cake, and an apple crumble cheesecake. Our server was exceptionally friendly, as were the other servers who checked in to provide refills of coffee or water and remove our plates.
.
The restaurant is very family-friendly. There were groups of seniors, parents with young children, couples on dates, and even a group of younger women out to brunch together. It was very welcoming and the overall experience was simply comforting.
.
I would definitely recommend stopping in to try one of their specials next time you're on Queen Street East!"

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Brent Bosma,3 years ago, 5 stars ,Food cold poor service 12.00 for cold chesse sandwiches and frys no salad dressing asked 3 people before I received it and never asked what kind I wanted. Veggie Burger good but forget onions and mushrooms brought in side dish cold. 150.00 4 4 chesse sandwiches 1 veggie burger 4 drinks. Sandwich was supposed to be on Texas Toast and was on thin cheap wheat toast. Was excited drove from Niagara Falls very disappointed when we got there pleasant environment. When I expressed how cold all the food was how long were you had waited and that it was incorrect toast no offer of compensation was made or apology I noticed anybody that has a complaint here many restaurants come back on with the owner of a reason complaints an offer to try to make it up so you'll come back I need to find a new restaurant in the beaches I will never return and no matter how many good reviews they have here I should just people don't go there because I don't know why anyone would give him a the food was cold the portions were small the service was poor there was high and there was a fly right around our food the entire time and nobody turn on the ceiling fans on a warm summer day to distract the flies from bothering the food. All in all a disappointing an overpriced meal. No one mines paying for a meal if the food is good in the service is nice. The only thing I can say good about this restaurant is it was cute in the inside and had a lovely patio. Don't go there if you're a vegetarian or I suspect even a meat eater and you want a good meal. Feel free to go there if you want to pay $150 for a $30 meal but isn't great. The food and service was so bad that I feel compelled to leave a very rude review and go back and edit it and add more she feeling bad about my total experience.

The waitstaff was very apologetic, and it‚Äôs not her fault, but this is unacceptable for a restaurant of any kind."

Waiter approached three times within fifteen minutes to see if we were ready to order.  And the restaurant was close to empty!!!!!!  Ordered the tuna melts, just to get rid of the waiter.  Within five minutes he was back with the tasteless meal.  Barely luke warm melted cheese over flaked tuna on an English Muffin.  Sounds yummy.  It wasn't. Sat like a rock on my stomach because I was rushing to finish it so waiter could clear the table.  Was in and out within 40 minutes. Bad."
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,John Jukna,3 years ago, 5 stars ,A very relaxing cafe just up from the beach. In my experience the cafe was never too busy and is spacious for any occasion. The food was fantastic with there being daily special boards to keep everything new. If you go in the morning Id recommend the eggs benedict and in the afternoon there brie burgers are ones not to miss out on. The staff are super friendly offering drinks at regular intervals.

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Mario Laroche,3 years ago, 4 stars ,My rating is based on the 15 mins I was there waiting for a table at the door. It wasn't busy at all and the servers were walking slowly around all angry and annoyed. We watched two argue and it was just a disaster. We over heard people saying their orders were wrong. People went up to pay and a server yelled at them when they asked for service. I think we dodged a bullet by leaving..

The benny has only two eggs but was more expensive than Sunset Grill (3 egg bennies), and much less tasty. Their ‚Äúfamous‚Äù hollandaise sauce was really weird and awful. It‚Äôs a strange colour and kind of clear, like it‚Äôs a lot of cream of tartar, and totally flavourless. I asked for an English muffin with the benny instead of a croissant but they gave me a croissant anyway and it was not a pleasant combo. The pancakes were also very bland. The amount of food they give you is TINY for the price."

The one star is for just about the worst dinner expereince ive ever had anywhere in the world. The worst service pure rudness and unprofessional. It was almost like they didnt want us to come in.

The food was such a pale comparsion to the breakfast/brunch they do, litterly night and day. I wish i remember to take a photo, i looked at the plate and just asked for the bill. I wanted to just walk out which i should have.  ""Soluvlaki chicken dinner"" The plate had 5 tiny pi√®ces of chicken spread out like islands and cold fries im guessing they we're frozen?!??? It looked frost burnt.

Finally No way the owner knows this is going on. No one in there right mind would run a restaurant like this on a street with such a high reputation."

They have terrific daily specials, and something for everyone!
I always get the Eggs Benedict on a croissant, both because I am a creature of habit, and because it is DELICIOUS!
I high recommend this restaurant!"

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,78shovl,4 years ago, 5 stars ,"Really dissapointing. Brought my parents and toddler out for a nice Saturday brunch. Arrived just before the rush. Kitchen lost our order and we had to wait over an hour to get our food. Waitress apologized but no offer of compensation given which would have helped. My mom‚Äôs waffles were cold and my French toast had a bit of a garlic taste most likely due to an unclean grill. This is the second time I‚Äôve experienced slow service. As much as I love the ambiance and menu options, I won‚Äôt be giving this restaurant any more chances."

While the menu is traditional and the food is pretty basic, it suits everyone's needs. We come here when we have a group, kids or people of various ages. They wisely pad their menu with multiple specials each day to keep things interesting.
It may not knock your socks off the first time you come, but it may become a favourite, cozy regular spot."

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Mark Chown (MPChown),6 years ago, 5 stars ,Nice patio and fun place in the summer time. Great vibe. Very relaxed.
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Armie N,6 years ago, 5 stars ,"Together with a group of 10 on Sunday @ noon, we order 10 breakfast/brunch. Service was ok, but food was soso. It wasn't hot! Maybe because they have to bring all ten dishes at once, mine was made earlier? But shouldn't they have heaters? What's worst even the cappuccino wasn't hot enough. I could drink it all the was as soon as it was served. This place mandate 18% gratuity based on the after tax amount, and do not allow separate bills."

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Paul Austin-Menear,6 years ago, 4 stars ,"(Translated by Google) Very good brunch, the drinks are good, the plates well stocked.

(Original)
Tr√®s bon brunch, les boissons sont bonnes, les assiettes bien garnies."
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Diana Lee,6 years ago, 4 stars ,"Great server, great location, pretty standard restaurant food with a bit of European/French feel (they bring the specials up on board a plant them on a chair near you to read).  A bit pricey for the food's level of deliciousness but the food was cooked and seasoned reasonably well."

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Dave Ringer,6 years ago, 4 stars ,"I love their Gluten Free bread! Helena always provides wonderful service, great breakfasts and family atmosphere. Unfortunately, you can hear across the restaurant when the owner is in the building by the way he yells horribly. I was literally looking for an escape route the 1st time I heard it, thinking a violent ex-employee was on a rampage in the kitchen. Charges for any and all substitutions really add up as well."

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Andy Ferber,6 years ago, 2 stars ,I had the beacher burger. My wife had the beacher club with our 16 month old son. Had amazing service and great food. Highly recommended.
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,C√©line Verrier-Fletcher,6 years ago, 4 stars ,"I assume that most people go here for the all day breakfast and brunch stuff but my wife and I went  here on a weekday for lunch.  We ordered some pretty simple menu items which the waitress agreed were good choices.  But for drinks we thought we would try the smoothies.  Hilarious. These were more like slushees with a fake fruit flavour and no real sign of fruit that I could see.  The arches make better smoothies.    My wife had the fish and chips and I had the club sandwich which boasts ""real turkey"" as an ingredient.   Sadly when the sandwich came I was hugely disappointed.  Basically three pieces of ordinary brown toast with this really thinly slice turkey that was seared on the flat top.  The peameal bacon was very thin and seared as well.  Nice lettuce and tomato but an OK effort at best.  Not recommended.   The fries on my order were fresh but had an odd odour like cheap oil... not pleasant.   My wife's fish and chips looked ok but generally we like more fish than batter.  The fish seemed a bit underdone for me.  It is again an OK effort but not terribly good.   We were given glasses of water and asked if this was tap water.  Yup.. not filtered like most restaurants today.   Yuck.. undrinkable.
I am sure this place pleases the families who come here later in the morning but I would suggest this is not really a proper restaurant for a decent meal other than the all day breakfast stuff."
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Natalie Dash,6 years ago, 5 stars ,"Went they're for lunch, great service and food!"
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Diana Mancuso,6 years ago, 4 stars ,"Good, friendly service and quiet atmosphere can't overcome over-priced, mediocre food and over-priced beer. Can't recommend."

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Patrick Antinozzi,9 years ago, 3 stars ,
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,paulinezed,9 years ago, 4 stars ,"The food is ok. Mediocre. Value for ok food is low, because it's priced high for what you're getting. ex. simple 'not chunky' grilled chicken on a bun with what they call a salad (which is really a handful of mixed greens) is $14. If value was high for ok food, it wouldn't be as bad. But not even that. Portions not high either for low quality food."
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Brian Crockford,9 years ago, 4 stars ,"The specials are always good, and the regular menu is too. Breakfast, esp. Eggs Benedict and Benjamin, are super. Reliable, friendly, and close to the Beach."
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Andrew Tischler,9 years ago, 4 stars ,
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Pop Hill,9 years ago, 3 stars ,"Not a place for fine dining, but it's a friendly place, and fantastic if you have kids.  They bring watermelon slices for the little ones while you decide on your order and there are colouring books and crayons available.  And the food is pretty good.  (Good pizza, and their tender calamari is a personal favourite.)"
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Carlo Romano,10 years ago, 3 stars ,
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Christophe F.,10 years ago, 5 stars ,A solid neighborhood restaurant that I always enjoy going to.  Great chicken on a bun and waffles on weekends.
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Jonathan Horsman,12 years ago, 5 stars ,I would say the food is fair and certainly not a place for fine dining.  It basically just meets the minimum for a fair breakfast joint.
