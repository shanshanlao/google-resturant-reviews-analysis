Bud's Coffee,Queen St E,dave deece,9 months ago, 1 star ,The drip coffee was gross. Tasted like luke warm salt water. I ended up throwing it out.
Bud's Coffee,Queen St E,Christy Escanga,10 months ago, 3 stars ,Expensive coffee ..I got a cortado and I was expecting the nice strong and soft taste characteristic of a good cortado; instead I got a bitter coffee. It might be the kind of coffee they use?? The long line outside of the store is kin if deceiving. Maybe other coffee in the menu taste better.

We had a coffee there every morning, and each coffee was consistently good! Their iced coffee was also exactly how I like it, and not overly sweetened like Starbucks!
If you're ever in the area, this is definitely the best place to get coffee!"
Bud's Coffee,Queen St E,Natalie Taylor,a year ago, 5 stars ,"This is ""the local"" coffee shop and during COVID, they've made a coffee take-out window pretty charming. Whether you're getting a coffee or a pastry, service is fast and friendly. Perfect excuse to take your drink on a walk to the beach down the street."
Bud's Coffee,Queen St E,K K,a year ago, 3 stars ,Thanks Natalie!!üëç
Bud's Coffee,Queen St E,Shamrock Anton,a year ago, 5 stars ,"Cute walk up coffee spot in the Beaches. The downside is there‚Äôs no patio or seating area so it‚Äôs a grab and go spot. I tried the drinks so can‚Äôt speak to the food/snacks.

They charge extra for iced drinks which doesn‚Äôt seem necessary as it‚Äôs the same drink with a few iced cubes."

I'd come here again for a treat and tasty cup of tea.

Bud's Coffee,Queen St E,Roman,3 years ago, 5 stars ,"This is the perfect quintessential neighbourhood espresso and coffee shop.  When I bring friends to The Beach and/or Toronto, I always bring them here. It speaks for itself.  Bud‚Äôs provides superb quality drinks in a relaxed and inviting neighbourhood atmosphere. Ken, Sarah, Rose, Kyle and Ryan and rest of the gang all produce excellent espresso.  Whenever I travel outside of Toronto and have espresso at other far flung locales, I realize some of the best espresso simply comes from my own neighbourhood in the Beach. The shop emulates everything that is so wonderful and soulful about this neighbourhood. Just simple good wholesome espresso. No gimmicks here."

They also have amazing artisan pasteries (ie. Poptarts). They have been open several seasons but are now in a new location slightly more east on Queen St. (closer to Lion On The Beach) BONUS *** this new location is bigger and has allowed them to set up more tables and a cute play space for kids under three

Bud's Coffee,Queen St E,Astrum Rimor,4 years ago, 5 stars ,"Very rude!, was a daily customer. Showed up christmas eve for my daily latte at 730 , no holiday hours posted. The young man working inside saw me standing there and we made eye contact 3 times over 15 minutes. Finally i knocked on the door to ask the hours and he came out and told me 8 oclock. You would think if you saw a customer standing out front that you would take 30 seconds out of your day to let them know when they can come in.

i will not return"
Bud's Coffee,Queen St E,Dave Power,4 years ago, 4 stars ,"Jim,
I apologize for the late notice in getting back to you.  I am sincerely sorry for everything that happened on that morning.  There is no excuse for any of it.  I would like to offer you a $20 gift card to make up for the inconvenience and the way you were treated.  Please let me know if you would accept this and I will leave it for you with our staff. Again, I am deeply sorry.
Best,
Sarah"

Sandwiches and breakfast sandwhich was are good but  overpriced for what you get."
Bud's Coffee,Queen St E,Veronica Morera,4 years ago, 5 stars ,Good little coffee hole on the Beaches. Great non-coffee options too. There is not a ton of seating.
Bud's Coffee,Queen St E,A Cartier,4 years ago, 4 stars ,"Mixed reviews. Lattes are good.
Cafe au lait not so much. They used brewed coffee (would have preferred a shot of espresso or a stronger brewed coffee) with steamed milk and charged the same price as a latte - what a disappointment."

Bud's Coffee,Queen St E,John Orzel,4 years ago, 5 stars ,"I feel like the Beaches are purposely keeping Bud's under wraps and not letting anyone know about this spot. I had no idea about Bud's and was dreading of finding a good cup in a new spot. With the overwhelming positives for this spot, I stepped into their door and was happy to Sam James beans being used.

Recently, it sounds like they moved to a bigger spot and still making a great cup. It is still very busy... even on a lazy Saturday afternoon, there was no tables freed up and the constant line up was in and out of the place. It has a great friendly vibe and everyone here is quite warm with each other. It's clear that Bud's has made themselves part of the community because of the number of personal conversations between patrons or the staff and patrons. This was really nice to see. I guess Toronto can be friendly after all!

I have to appreciate how they use the good Canadian brands like Pluck and Cut Coffee to create their drinks. Nothing like supporting a good local. I think the baristas really know their drinks cause the flat whites we got were surpassing some of the well known coffee shops that sit on Toronto top 50.

Flat White with almond milk - The butter knife beans are just so good and Bud's did them right. This was a rich and robust coffee flavour with a touch of milkiness from the microfoamed milk. No acidity to make me wince. We decided to do the cashew and almond milk side by side taste test. I personally liked the almond milk more. I found it didn't influence the flat white as much and let the coffee flavour be more forward. I liked this one. 4/5

Flat White with cashew milk - I found the cashew milk version to have less of a coffee flavour... it definitely changed the taste. I would say it was a milkier flavour but more muted for sure. I did find cashew milk to be creamier than the almond milk but also weirdly enough, I touch more sweet? So if you're looking for the texture the most closest to cow's milk, this would probably be your favourite alternative milk. Kudos to Buds for offering more than one type of nut milk. 4/5

If I'm far out east again, I'll definitely make Bud my choice to get a good flat white and happy I'm not stuck to Starbucks."
