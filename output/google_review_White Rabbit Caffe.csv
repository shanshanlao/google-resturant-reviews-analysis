White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Nikita Su,a day ago, 4 stars ,"This place has it's pro's and cons. The drinks taste delicious and the cappuccino I had reminded me of cappuccinos' I've had in Europe however it was double the price. The croissant I had wasn't the best. It wasn't soft, rather tough and chewy which was unfortunate. I did like the ambience and the setup inside. It is quite a beautiful caf√© with great tasting coffee but it misses the mark."
White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Anne Mary Pham,2 weeks ago, 5 stars ,"Great coffee and decent vibes. There isn‚Äôt much space to sit/work, so I wouldn‚Äôt come here to study. But this place definitely serves a great flat white!"
White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Zahra Rajaei,2 weeks ago, 5 stars ,"Small, minimalistic and cute caffe with nice and friendly staff. There are not much sitting spaces but very well designed to have a calming vibe. I also love the menu as it is pretty straight forward and compartmented so you don‚Äôt need to spend half an hour to choose your order.
Their croissants was OK, not the best."
White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Anne,4 weeks ago, 5 stars ,"Such a cute, minimalistic little caf√© with great coffee and pastries. I loved the pistachio oat milk latte and croissants. All the staff are so nice, you'll feel relaxed and at home here."
White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Maia Iris,4 weeks ago, 5 stars ,Cute and compact cafe which also sells coffee beans and a small array of pastries. The pistachio latte is fantastic!
White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Grace David,2 months ago, 4 stars ,"Another overpriced cafe but oh how I love it. A little sad that they only have 3 functional tables so if you are planning to go there to work, don‚Äôt. Or at-least have a backup plan. Tea was good but not worth five dollars. Pastries however, were phenomenal and I thoroughly enjoyed their raspberry croissant.

The atmospheres is really cute and service was quick and kind so I may try to come early to get a table and study for the day, but not to sure if it‚Äôs worth it."
White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Healani Norman,3 months ago, 4 stars ,"Very minimalistic coffee shop, I love it!!! The menu is easily compartmentalized so you're not spending twenty minutes deciding or even trying to locate what you want. I ordered the latte and my husband got the cappuccino, both of which came out with perfect micro foam. The croissant was on par being light and fluffy. We sat outside at one of the tables out front and people watched for a little while. Very lovely overall :)"
White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,A Dreamer (ASA),3 months ago, 4 stars ,"I don‚Äôt usually go to small cafes like this (I go to big mainstream ones) but coming to this one on a whim at 8AM on a rainy morning was very cathartic. I‚Äôm not in Toronto all the time, so in a dry corner outside I spent 10 mins trying to find a cafe open, as it was 7:30am and many came up and frankly I walked the distance to a few, to which I couldn‚Äôt find and or cafes that didn‚Äôt feel right. When I saw this one I was pulled in b/c the name and honestly I‚Äôm glad I made the walking trip in the cold that morning. I had a version of a green tea White Rabbit Caffe offered & it was very bitter but that‚Äôs green tea for you üòÇ it was a big cup, I spent an hour or so here with my air buds in and I was not bothered. A place to try for the vibes, friends."

White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Tyler TM,4 months ago, 4 stars ,"This local coffee shop has some great stuff.  Coffee is really high quality and quite affordable.  It‚Äôs a small little place, so maybe not super idea for working/studying but there‚Äôs room if you need to.  Drink specials can run a bit on the pricier side, so I‚Äôd stick to the classics"
White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Jessie C,4 months ago, 4 stars ,Small and cozy cafe. Nice ambiance but limited seating. Came in to order matcha latte with oat milk and it tasted great!

White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Melissa B,5 months ago, 5 stars ,"I love this little spot. Great to get some work done and have a cappuccino :) Indoor and outdoor seating with good wifi. The cold tea is also good, the barista made me one with lichee and it was delicious."
White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Kathleene Sim,6 months ago, 5 stars ,"I've been searching for a cafe that opens early in the morning ~7AM on weekdays so I can spend some time having breakfast before I head over to work. I'd always known this caf√© existed but I never took the leap to visit until today, and I'm really glad I took that chance.

The exterior is tiny and unassuming, but when you come in, you're invited into a small, cozy space filled with greenery in the form of decor, and lots of seating. It's a very home-y atmosphere and has this unpolished vibe to it ‚Äì I liked it; it reminded me of a cafe I used to visit while in school.

I ordered a lavender latte and pistachio croissant. The barista was kind and helpful with describing the lavender latte, as I had some concerns. They were also able to sub in oat milk, as I'm a bit lactose intolerant.

I love lavender in theory, but any strong aromas of it truthfully turns me away. The latte I got was like the idea of lavender; the flavour was definitely there, but in a really subtle way, which is how I'd hoped it to be. The pistachio croissant was GREAT. They really didn't skimp on that filling.

I'll be back soon to try the rest of the menu!"
White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Tiffany Santos,7 months ago, 5 stars ,Highly recommend the lavender and pistachio latte!
White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Adel B,7 months ago, 1 star ,"Dissapointing experience. The drinks are very watered down, and the lids don't even fit properly so it spills when you try to drink which stained my pants.

In addition, although there are straws, they don't give you them and they don't even fit.

I hope this business improves because it definitely does not deserve over 2 stars..."
White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,F J Iturralde,7 months ago, 5 stars ,"Awesome service. Great presentation. Nice Aesthetics. Good coffee. Good Pastries. If Ethan is in there, you'll have a great service."
White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Megan Fleming,7 months ago, 3 stars ,"Friendly experience and DELICIOUS iced lavender latte! I was excited to check out this caf√© when I learned it had zero plastic, but it seems their to-go iced drinks cups are not zero plastic. I have been to other caf√©s with to-go iced drink cups that look like plastic but are indeed compostable, but this one has a recyclable symbol. I'd go back for a hot drink or to eat-in, but I was disappointed that their iced drink cups are not plastic-free despite being a zero plastic caf√©."
White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Ramya Gudipudi,7 months ago, 2 stars ,"Ordered oat latte but had weird after taste for some reason, not sure it‚Äôs with espresso or oat milk. Not interested to visit again!"

White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Natalia Marchenko,10 months ago, 1 star ,"The barista has to do a bit of training on the drinks preparation and customer service. Very unhappy to get the extremely diluted Americano on Wednesday.

The place also needs a very good clean. Not sure what the owner tries to achieve with dried-out potted plants and dust everywhere."
White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Mike Di Donato,10 months ago, 5 stars ,"Best espresso on Bay street. Anytime i am in this area i make a point to stop here and have a coffee, great staff, great atmosphere and amazing espresso."

White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Adriana Naffah,a year ago, 5 stars ,"Honestly love the place. Yes the coffee is good. Yes the pastries are delicious and fresh with multiple unique choices.

But what took the 5 stars is how friendly the barista was. It's such a cute place to sit with such a good ambiance. I had recommandations, jokes, a smile and a very friendly voice. That's what made the difference. Would come back ."

White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Hitesh Thukral,a year ago, 4 stars ,"Above average coffee, decent brew and flavor but not much complexity in milk based drinks (haclvemt tried the espresso or Americano by itself),  great croissants, would like a wider selection of pastries though"
White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Geoffrey L,a year ago, 5 stars ,"Best coffee on Bay Street. The little pastries are nice but the lattes are just amazing.

They're also super nice people. I forgot to bring my wallet once and the owner offered to give me the coffee for free. I declined came back immediately from my office to pay for it. It's honestly the best caf√© around in my opinion."

White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,A O,a year ago, 5 stars ,"Cute small Cafe but good amount of indoor and outdoor seats. I always order the lavender latte because it's so good. I haven't had any of the baked goods and the other beverages but the menu looks pretty interesting. Next time,  I'll try something new.  Staff are pleasant as well.

Update:
Pistachio latte is amazing. The croissants are great too!"

He and the store itself were some of my fav things about that neighborhood when I lived there. So much better than Timmies. Keep it up!!
White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Payam Emadi,a year ago, 5 stars ,Nice spot
White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Adam Schneider,a year ago, 5 stars ,"I‚Äôd give this place 10 stars if I could. For one thing, the espresso was great, and every americano or latte or flat white I got was perfect. For another, the owner (who was most often the person behind the counter when we went in) was a breath of fresh air - one of the few people in the city who was friendly, personable, and treated my wife and me as human beings. He‚Äôd always smile, chat, and he remembered our orders and things we told him. People often talk about ‚Äúlocal gems‚Äù and this place is the dictionary definition of that term. If I hadn‚Äôt left the city, I‚Äôd be there every day."
White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Nero T,a year ago, 4 stars ,Quant cafe with indoor and outdoor seating. Tasty croissants and coffee. They have milk alternatives for those who prefer
White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Ncedile Mankahla,a year ago, 5 stars ,"Excellent cafe. The owner understands coffee well and pulls great cups, he is attentive to his customers and their preferences and is pleasantly hospitable. One of the better places in Toronto. A city with an under developed coffee culture."
White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Tenzo,a year ago, 4 stars ,americano's fairly mild but balanced
White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Timothy K,a year ago, 2 stars ,"The White Rabb was really missing ""it"" (see photo).

The most disappointing part of this coffee shop was that it has high reviews (4.7) at the time of writing this. In reality this is a 2-3 star coffee shop. The flat white was overly milky and technically a latte -I would say it fell flat. The google listing writes ""sandwiches and salads"" but middle of the day they only had like, 5-6 croissants to chose from and there was a fly on them. If you want to eat, go elsewhere.

Edit: Saw the owner's reply below, unfortunately the review wasn't written the same day as the experience took place so I doubt the ""barista in training"" excuse (also because I only saw one employee on site that day (Tuesday Oct 12th, app. 11:30am) and I'm fairly certain the barista that served us was the owner) and, I do appreciate the offer of a free coffee but we had come to the establishment for the sandwiches and salads, hopefully you guys will have that in the future."
White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Elida Nexha,a year ago, 5 stars ,"In LOVE with this place and their lavender latte!!!
Just keep in mind that the cafe is a bit small and I‚Äôm not sure if there are any outlets (in case you come to study)."
White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Swaraj Kashyap,a year ago, 5 stars ,Love the Special Lattes
White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Max Y,a year ago, 2 stars ,Been here for a couple of times. Lavender latte is so good and is also the main reason I go. Else I‚Äôll definitely choose other coffee shops because of the customer service of the male barista. Whenever I bump into the male barista his attitude somehow just makes you uncomfortable. The female barista is excellent.

White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Ramy Saboungui,a year ago, 5 stars ,"If you're around and have some time, grab your coffee from here!

A good place for your coffee dose, they make interesting creations and their bakery and brunch items are worth the try.

White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Yun Shen,a year ago, 5 stars ,"I love this place. I've visited from time to time over the past year, and they haven't let me down yet. Espresso was smooth, rich, and ever so slightly tart. It's perfect. Cold brew is also excellent. Pastries are always sold out in the afternoon. I like to order the cheese croissant when they're not sold out, a very tasty treat."
White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Stephen Tadgh,a year ago, 4 stars ,Took me a while to find somewhere that does a good flat white in the city but these guys didn't let me down! Great little coffee spot for anyone who is looking to branch out from the Tim Hortons and Starbucks!
White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,George Harvey,a year ago, 5 stars ,One of the best places for coffee in the city! Coffee is great! Desserts are decadent and amazing. My friend says ‚Äúdamn good lemonade‚Äù. Been here three times and I have never been disappointed. This will has been my new coffee place since Coffee Public moved.
White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Sally Chung,a year ago, 5 stars ,Cute little cafe! Loved the interior. Also picked up the last two pastries that were available with my coffee - one was an apple croissant and the other a donut and I didn't regret it!
White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Andrew Gong,a year ago, 5 stars ,"I take a longer walk to this cafe because of the unique latte flavors that are not usually offered at other cafes, such as pistachio latte. I personally like their patio because though located on Bay Street, there‚Äôs not much foot/car traffic, especially as the sidewalk is wide on this portion of Bay Street. However, the patio is less ideal for patrons who prefer more shading from the sun as there isn‚Äôt much shading for most seats."

White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Bindu,a year ago, 1 star ,"Places that don't want to serve customers same quality of coffee during a promotion shouldn't participate in them. I was shopping around for a coffee shop that I could frequent, ordered an iced coffee from Ritual and got a watered down, weak drink. Went to Mos Mos just down the road that seems to know the point of promotions: to induce patronage. Which they did successfully. I'll buying my iced coffee and Bloomers' donuts at Mos Mos in the future"

White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Vincent Tse,a year ago, 5 stars ,I‚Äôm no coffee expert but this place deserves all the praise it gets. I highly recommend the pistachio latte and the mocha latte. Has a higher price tag but worth it as this is the best latte I‚Äôve had in a long time.

White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,em ily,2 years ago, 1 star ,"The owner of this cafe can be very nice. I have been pre-COVID and he is very keen to engage every one of his customers. That being said, post-COVID I have been semi-terrified by his utter lack of respect for the guidelines. The last five times I have passed by or gone into the store to get something the man has his mask either not covering his nostrils or not covering his mouth at all! I have seen other reviewers mention this behavior and also seen the owner reply with an excuse like ""you came in when the cafe was empty"" but he definitely still does this when plenty of people are in the store. I definitely go less than I did before COVID because of this behaviour. There are plenty of other cafes that are rule-abiding and that have products that are just as good."

White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,William Khalil,2 years ago, 5 stars ,"2020.10.05. Our visit to White Rabbit is becoming a ritual. A great one. All the family loves their coffee ... Hot Americano and Iced Americano. Thank you @snapturethis for the initial recommendation to visit White Rabbit and for the special coffee display of lovely coffee prints by @snapturethis (you should visit the place, try their coffee, and see the prints). We support local businesses. We love coffee.

2020.08.24. Our second coffee of the day was a visit to a favorite coffee place ""White Rabbit Cafe Toronto"". Our family is specialized in coffee tasting. We visit and drink a lot of coffee at many places. This place is a top scorer. Try their coffee you will not regret it. We sat outside and it was very pleasant.  Bravo WRCT."

White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Toby Whitfield,2 years ago, 3 stars ,"Great coffee, but yikes for COVID risk. This place is tiny, and shouldn't have tables, as those using them are unmasked. The server had his mask pulled down over his chin, with mouth and nose totally exposed, and no other physical barrier.

White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Emily L.,2 years ago, 5 stars ,"I visited this place after my friends recommended to me. I tried their pistachio latte and it was by far, the best one I've ever tried. Also loved the atmosphere and the interior design. I felt warm and was welcomed by friendly staff. All of these factors led me to visiting the place 3 times out of the 6 days I was in Toronto!"

White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,M K,2 years ago, 5 stars ,"Cute cafe opened on Bay St (north of Gerrard). The interior is beautiful. I have spoken to the owner a number of times and he put so much effort and thought into the design of this place. The pastries look amazing, I have tried the butter croissant. The espresso is great. I could sit here for hours! There is wifi. They are no plastic! They have oatmilk for your drinks for free. The bathroom is super cute too and so clean. A must go in the area!

Update: Owner has added a patio, which is excellent especially during COVID. Wifi reaches table outside (close to window) which is great!"

White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Dmitry Romanenko,2 years ago, 5 stars ,"Decent coffee, friendly atmosphere, amazing Barista. Coffee beans are having very rich taste that remind me of Black Canary beans. Thumbs up!

I have concerns about quite small space inside. There's probably no point to fit so many tables and chairs inside if you can't let people sit so close in current pandemic realities. This space instead could be reliably used for waiting area."
White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Chaitanya ‚ÄúChai‚Äù Narula,2 years ago, 5 stars ,"This is my favorite place in the area. First and foremost, the coffee is absolutely amazing and to top it off, the owner sources some top quality baked goodies. The mugs are unprinted, stamped and compostable. He uses organic, really good quality milk and is just a great person to have a quick conversation while the fresh brew is prepared."

White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Phoenix Kiula,2 years ago, 4 stars ,Excellent coffee. Great to have this as an option to Hailed in the neighborhood. The coffee bean could be fuller bodied. It seems Canadians like their coffee mild. I miss the coffee from Sydney. The barista seems to be the owner too and he‚Äôs a master of the making art: each cup is meticulously made. The blueberry croissant is gorgeous. If the coffee itself was a bit stronger this would be a 5 star in my book.

White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Ishrat Trishna,2 years ago, 5 stars ,"This is an exceptional little cafe! The cozy and welcoming decor is what drew me in on a grey, windy day. The owner is fun to chat with and the drinks were phenomenal. I had a latte and my husband had a hit chocolate and both were top notch! I'm so excited to be a patron here hopefully for a long time to come."
White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Pranay Garg,2 years ago, 5 stars ,"White rabbit is the place to be! I love the coffee here. Amazing coffee, fresh ingredients. Unlike many popular chains the shop uses real ground coffee instead of chocolate syrups for mocha and it has quickly become my favourite. I have also grown a liking to pistachio latte, a coffee with notes of pistachio mixed in latte and a wonderful aftertaste. Wether you need your daily coffee fix or looking to elevate your experience of drinking coffee, white rabbit is your place!"

White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Sergei Makarov,3 years ago, 4 stars ,"Please either change your hours or don't close 15 minutes earlier. I went to your place at 19:45 today and the barista was already closing the cafe because ""there were no clients for the last hour"". Two other people arrived at the same time and also were turned away. Very frustrating experience.
Otherwise the place is great, pastries are especially good."

White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Rebecca Wilkinson,3 years ago, 5 stars ,Super cute little cafe on Bay street that serves up 10/10 espressos and great pastries (the pistachio croissants are especially amazing). They also serve a bunch of vegan or vegetarian options for lunch like veggie bowls and sandwiches. It's a nicely designed and cozy spot to sit down and hang out in if you are in the area.
