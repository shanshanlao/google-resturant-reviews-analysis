Dispatch Coffee,Bay St,Dmitry Romanenko,a week ago, 5 stars ,"Comfy coffee spot inside of business center with tables. I was satisfied with quality of coffee and amount of available minimalistic seating area, but was a bit disappointed that when my coffee was meant to be brought by staff upstairs, but wasn't after 15 minutes, and when I found out that it's waiting at pickup area I had to bring it upstairs myself. I suggest they should either bring themselves or tell customers exactly that they should take care of it."

Dispatch Coffee,Bay St,J P,a month ago, 5 stars ,My fav Montreal coffee finally made it to Toronto. Their beans are top notch with depth of flavour and profiles like few out there. I have been a subscription member for a number of years and have enjoyed everything I have recieved. A must try in my books.

Dispatch Coffee,Bay St,dikshant grover,a month ago, 5 stars ,"My new favourite place to work and have amazing Montreal coffee!
It’s serendipitous because I remember walking into a dispatch during my first trip of Montreal last January and the barista told me a Toronto one would open in the near future.
Part of me wants this place to stay a little hidden so that it doesn’t become 120% occupied most of the time like most Toronto cafes.."

Dispatch Coffee,Bay St,EUNJEONG LEE,3 months ago, 5 stars ,"Hands down the best coffee shop in the city.
Everyone is super nice. It's a huge space nested in the financial district. Perfect spot to relax or do some work. The coffee is 11/10 and they rotate the beans everyday."

Dispatch Coffee,Bay St,Marine,3 months ago, 5 stars ,"I always go to dispatch every after gym, but today, the barista wasnt that approachable, didnt even ask me if I want it hot or cold and just put what I said and asked me to pay then made my drink. So he made me the iced one, but I didnt told him that I want it hot. I know its my fault for forgetting, but I think its better to clarify things first as well before making a drink. Been to many coffee shops around downtown but I always go back to dispatch because of the great coffee, but I guess not anymore. Service is one of the most important aspects to attain customers. 😊"

It is a coffee shop where you can sit quietly and enjoy coffee in downtown Toronto.
There are about 8 tables on the 2nd floor, so you can sit and drink coffee. The customers are quiet, and there is quiet music in the cafe, so it seems to be a good space to come and read a book or study. The staff taking the order was also very kind, so I remember going there after drinking a pleasant coffee.

토론토 다운타운 내 조용하고 앉아서 커피를 즐길 수 있는 커피전문점 입니다
2층에 8개 정도의 테이블이 있어서 커피를 받고 앉아서 마실 수 있습니다. 손님들도 조용하고 카페 안에도 조용한 음악이 나와서 잠시 와서 책을 읽거나 공부 하기에 좋은 공간인 듯 합니다. 주문을 받는 직원 분도 너무 친절해서 기분 좋게 커피를 마시고 간 기억이 남습니다"

Dispatch Coffee,Bay St,Ben V,5 months ago, 4 stars ,"Went there to check out the coffee. Coffee shop is cute, seating is on second level with tables and couches. Has 11 types of ground available for purchase. I tried the Guatemala espresso ground today, on the bitter end with citrus/nectarine notes. Strong espresso. Has pastries and cookie treats. Cortado was $4.90 total. Good spot to check out downtown. Unsure if it would be my go to spot."

Dispatch Coffee,Bay St,Benny Tong,a year ago, 4 stars ,"No way is this a 4.7 in terms of actual coffee. Beautiful shop and great location. But coffee bean is now fruity mild Canadian rubbish, and baristas are often undertrained and overworked so they make a quick and dirty silly coffee I can make at home. Nor what this used to be. Still a decent rendezvous for meetings, but an ordinary coffee shop for actual coffee."
Dispatch Coffee,Bay St,Alexandra Marquez,a year ago, 5 stars ,"Hi there More Spinach - we're disappointed to hear you didn't enjoy your visit at our Toronto location. We'd like to hear more about the coffee you were served. You can reach us at info@dispatchcoffee.ca.

We are a third wave coffee roaster, thus our beans are roasted medium-light and are very different from say traditional Italian espresso cafés! We encourage you to read more about the coffee farmers we support here: www.dispatchcoffee.ca/pages/impact. Our baristas are well trained and experienced in the industry, but we understand if you didn't like the drink you ordered! Hoping to hear from you via email."
