NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Karl Sengupta,a week ago, 5 stars ,The best coffee in Toronto
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Hithasha Kurera,a week ago, 4 stars ,They didn’t have a lot of options when I visited at 4pm on a weekday but had the cookie choux which was really soft and delicious! The vanilla filling could have been a little flavourful in my opinion but it was still a nice treat for the price! Haven’t tried their drinks yet but can’t wait to try!
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,William Ye,a week ago, 3 stars ,"Excellent range of drinks, though the seating is a little crowded and during a busy afternoon you can barely hear your own thoughts."

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Nish,2 weeks ago, 5 stars ,"NEO is a really nice coffee shop to relax.
It has a wide space, and the staffs are always friendly.
I ordered the seasonal Kurogoma Hojicha Latte and it was delicious.
The only downside of this place is their wifi limitation to 1 hour."
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Khkllvc R,3 weeks ago, 5 stars ,"I had a wonderful experience at this cafe.The coffee and baked goods are delicious, and the atmosphere and seating areas are great. This is the perfect place to meet up with friends. For students in the area, the location is very good and the service is fast and friendly."
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Andrea Li Calzi,3 weeks ago, 4 stars ,"Been coming here for years, my only spot for matcha latte"
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Fatima A.S,3 weeks ago, 4 stars ,
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Athena Campbell,3 weeks ago, 4 stars ,"I've been to this location  many times the last 3 years. I have to say the quality of food and drinks has gotten better. It is a Japanese style cafe. They offer matcha lattes, roll cakes, cheesecakes, pastries, and lunch options. I usually stop by for a quick drink and pastry.

During the pandemic, I felt that the espresso based drinks were watery and pastries were stale. But after 2 visits in the last 30 days, I can say that the quality has improved significantly. I had a decaf latte, and the espresso was full-bodied and aromatic. I ordered a croissant, and it was soft, buttery, and fresh. I observed that their pastries were made in-house because I saw two bakers actively working away. I'm glad they have worked on their products, and it is reflected in their quality.

My total for a latte and croissant came up to $10, which is going to be pricey for some, but it is the norm for downtown coffeeshops. They have narrow bench style seating along the cafe and a community table. It can become busy and crowded, and the entrance area can be packed. Making it difficult to find seating or figure out which line to stand in to place an order.

On the bonus side, they have a ""Happy hour"" of their own for house made drinks.  You get 50% off the same drink that you ordered earlier in the day. You just have to have your copy of the receipt as proof."
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Flawnson Tong,3 weeks ago, 5 stars ,"Really cute coffee store with a really nice ambiance. Their treats are so yummy and their coffee was one of the best in the city.

It’s a perfect place to come and study/work or to catch up with friends. The staff are extremely friendly as well."
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Jarrett Smalley,a month ago, 3 stars ,"Good matcha lattes (they use a good oat milk too) albeit pricey, 7.50 for a large. It comes naturally sweetened to the right amount for my taste. The store gets pretty busy during the days."
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,pedram karimi,a month ago, 4 stars ,An average coffee + pastry morning. I did drink the coffee and eat the croissant. I cannot not say much beyond this.

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Caroline M,a month ago, 5 stars ,Incredible pastries. Coffee was perfect
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Steven C,a month ago, 5 stars ,"Cute little spot with great latte.
I love that they have no computer policy for a couple of hours so you can actually enjoy other people company of a good book.
Cookies were amazing as well."
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Virginia,a month ago, 4 stars ,
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Francesca Norte,a month ago, 4 stars ,"Favourite coffee shop to be at. Interior is one of the best and most comfortable imo in the area. Coffee is great! Not the best ive ever had but id gladly come here daily.

Matcha is very strong with heavy umami, be warned if that isnt your cup of tea

Many hours spent here studying and working.

Staff is always friendly as well"
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Marta Melinda Pap,a month ago, 5 stars ,This coffee shop offers tasty speciality drinks and baked goodies. Their cookies and muffins are good. Customer service is good and fast. The inside of the store is pretty spacious and clean. They have tables and seats on the side walk. The location is good for university students and office works but not ideal for drivers. I would visit if I want to socialize and treat myself or a friend.
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Alina Konstantinovna,a month ago, 5 stars ,"I give them 4 stars as the coffee and dessert I had were really good and the vibe was really nice. Definitely a good place to chat and catch up with friends over cafe drinks and Japanese inspired desserts. Service was also really nice and the washroom is kept clean.

They lose a star as they really don’t encourage any kind of laptop work which is evident in the way the space is designed as well as how their wifi works.

Majority of the tables are small and can only fit a laptop. They have one large table space if you need to use a mouse but that’s if there is space since larger groups typically take that space.

During the week they do allow laptop use (on weekends and statutory holidays laptops aren’t allowed) but they only allow you to connect to their wifi for 1hr. After an hour the wifi craps out and you won’t be able to renew your wifi time, at least that was my experience for both my laptop and mobile device.

If you’re looking for a space to work on your laptop for over an hour while having coffee/light bites during the week, this is not the place for you."
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,D. K.,a month ago, 5 stars ,Best ever Matcha latte in Toronto :) I cannot drink coffee for a while and this is absolutely the best alternative. I always take mine with oat milk. The design always brightens up my day. Thank you!
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,its_ asiancarlygirl,a month ago, 5 stars ,"So good, coffee is very tasty and deserts are nice, good atmosphere"
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Joy Lee,a month ago, 4 stars ,Excellent hojicha and matcha. Japanese-approve!
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Baowen Zhang,2 months ago, 5 stars ,"The seasonal hojicha latte taste so good, it has black sesame and hojicha in it, doesn’t include espresso but hojicha itself has little caffeine in it. The hot chocolate taste really nice in the winter. Latte art is so pretty as well! There’s also a coat hanger by the wall for customers, so for ppl who wants to take pictures, that’s perfect! Highly recommended!"
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Peanuts Butter,2 months ago, 4 stars ,"Neo is a beautiful coffee bar with an unique array of selections; including Japanese inspired pastries, mochi and drinks. The space is beautifully lit with natural lights with large communal table by the window.

My colleagues and I adore their espressos and Hojicha latte. My favourite drink is Neo's authentic Hojicha powder from Kyoto with foamy oat milk.

Neo Coffee Bar is the perfect space to visit for an afternoon pick-me-upper."
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Aliyah Rahman,2 months ago, 4 stars ,"Specialized in Japanese tea and latte. Dessert tastes good too. They have non laptop hours which promotes an environment where people just come here and connect with friends, not working"
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Sarah Nader,2 months ago, 3 stars ,"nice place to stay for chatting with friends or doing own readings, 1 hr wifi available, nice drink(ordered the large brewed coffee), can smell the spices, but only house blend or dark roast choices for beans. Still aromatic. quite a busy cafe but the japanese vibe of pastries are worth to try"
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Vi Wang,2 months ago, 4 stars ,Chocolate Cookies were good ..hot choc was fine
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,murathan,2 months ago, 5 stars ,Very cute and comfortable setting and the coffee tastes great! It would be a great study spot but the wifi times out at 1 hour which sucks

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Sanam Bakhshi,2 months ago, 4 stars ,"Great ambience and nice coffee.

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,George Tomou,3 months ago, 5 stars ,Creative food and coffee vendors
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Kate Connors,3 months ago, 5 stars ,"RECOMMENDATION - Overall, if you want light snacks that don't overwhelm you and a place to chill, this will be right in your alley.

Food  - I got the Egg Salad Sando, Black Tea, and Basque Cheese Cake. Out of the three, the one I enjoyed the most was the Cheesecake. The other two fell flat for me. It was just standard, light snacks. Not memorable, but not bad.

Service - Great! Quick, professional and friendly. They were swamped and were working non-spot. You have lovely people working there.

Ambiance - Lots of seating to gather to talk to friends. I saw a bunch of people able to chill and chat. I love the atmosphere, and it boosted the place for me.

Accessibility: Getting in was a bit dicey, and the seating was very cramped. However, everything was on the first floor.

EDIT - Added an extra star for their reply and willingness to change. Most companies don't do that! :)"

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,6 Kat,5 months ago, 4 stars ,"I adore this coffee place. Best coffee downtown. I come for coffee every weekend and noticed recent changes. The barista has changed; coffee is still best, but the serving upsets. Sometimes I get less coffee in a cup, no heart drawings on the top (so fewer customers want to take a picture and post it, so less advertising for Neo), and already twice got colder coffee than it should be. I love this place; I just hope that some work will be done with the new barista and the previous level of coffee serving will be back."
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Karina Kucherenko,5 months ago, 5 stars ,Coffee isn't bad but I ordered on their own website and they didn't even realize they had orders until I mentioned it. They also only allow you to use their wifi for 1 hour. After the hour is up you have to wait 2 hours before you can retry. Disappointing because a lot of people like to do work at cafes...

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Rodrigo Lobato,5 months ago, 5 stars ,"I really like their iced matcha latte I had at Japan Festival Canada 2022 so I decided to visit their store for the first time. Everything was fine when I ordered: ordered 2 iced matcha latte and one mochi to go. I didn’t know I need to get the lids myself so when the lady barista gave me the drinks without lids I just reminded her that’s for take away, and she looked very grumpy and rude just pointed and told me it’s over there. Speaking with the latte, I think the one I had at the festival was better, I think there’s not enough sugar and matcha taste can be stronger"

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Jose Rivera,5 months ago, 5 stars ,"Japanese inspired decor and cakes, but missing the Japanese inspired service.

We ordered some of their vegan cookies and coffee.  The service was surprisingly slow, especially for just drip coffee.  Our coffees arrived sticky and covered in syrup/honey.  The barista was also annoyed when we asked for another cup to cover the residue.

Great place to sit down for a cake or to chill out, but the service is a bit lacking."

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Moe Emami,6 months ago, 5 stars ,Very good coffee
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Samer Sultan,6 months ago, 5 stars ,"I saw this place online and saw they had pretty good reviews. However, when I went with my friend today I was really disappointed… the prices are high for what you get, I assumed that since it’s more expensive then most places it would be better, I was VERY wrong. We watched the girl make our drinks and it’s straight up milk with a splash of matcha and hojicha. We ordered three items total and it came up to $30… and the matcha tiramisu was not so good either and is served in a small dirty jar. Again you would think for that price it would be great, yeah save your money and go to Starbucks instead. I’m really sad and disappointed cause even the service wasn’t that great, the atmosphere is horrible if you plan on bringing a laptop cause there’s only two large tables available, the rest of the tables are the same size as a chair."

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Natalie Nasrallah,6 months ago, 5 stars ,This was my first visit to place and my experience wasn't really great; I probably had too high expectation based on higher rating and good reviews. The place was pretty busy with limited/uncomfortable seats and only 1hr free access to wifi. And most of the drinks and food menu were quite pricey for the size and quality of the products. Overrated.

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,T.,7 months ago, 2 stars ,"I haven't been to the NEO coffee bar for quite sometime and wanted to see if it had changed. I purchase a hojicha matcha iced latte and half a strawberry rolled cake. The drink is something amazing as it had a host of bitter, sweet and the cool ice melding into a drink. The strawberry roll was delicious which had plenty of strawberries, freshly whipped cream clustered in the centre of the sponge roll. I would like to try their other drinks like the genmicha as it sounds interesting."
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Liyun Xu,7 months ago, 4 stars ,"Lovely café but disappointing, rather weak coffee (unless they were just having a bad day when I dropped in). However, the Sandos were excellent, flavoursome and substantial (highly recommend the egg salad and the smoked salmon)."
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Nethanel Pryor,7 months ago, 5 stars ,Hi Steph! Thanks so much fort taking the time to write about your experience at NEO. We're sorry to hear we didn't quite hit the mark during your visit but do appreciate the kind words around our Sando offerings. They are great! Did you mention your concerns with the quality of your coffee with the Barista?
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,B G,7 months ago, 5 stars ,"Their pastries and sandwiches are pretty nice. Peach Roll Cake was light, not too peachy, but fluffy indeed. Egg Sando was nice except for the fact that the contents will slob if taken out of their packaging (which they don't bother cutting in the middle).

Place is nice but can get loud when patrons speak loudly. No noise absorption, sound just bounces everywhere. Will still come back though but maybe sit outside."
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Harsh Yadav,7 months ago, 2 stars ,Amazing place. Best coffee in the city. Try their flat white.
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Z Baghestani,7 months ago, 4 stars ,Had a great Oatmilk flat-white from here! Pastries were good too.

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Alexander Kudin,8 months ago, 5 stars ,"Best coffee shop in Toronto.
Impeccable quality. Very special selection of coffee variety."
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Lexi,8 months ago, 1 star ,"Picked up an Americano and almond croissant here on my way to work. First impression is that the space is really pretty with modern Japanese cafe vibes. I went in wanting a croissant and when I first saw it in the display, I ignored my first thoughts that it looked kind of deflated and very small, especially for almost $5.

The coffee was pretty good. A pretty standard Americano and there's a station for your milk and sugar by the door.

The almond croissant might be the worst I've ever had. First up, it's a narrow shape and small, not wider than even a standard credit card (see pic for reference). Second, the texture was like a dense tortilla because there were no layers inside which I suspect is because the dough wasn't proofed and collapsed while baking (see pics for reference).  Third, the flavour was so off. It had no almond extract aroma or much flavour at all. Instead, because the croissant sits beside the rosemary cheddar croissant in the display, my croissant took on all the essence of sharp cheddar and rosemary and it was so off putting.

I've heard good things about their cakes but I don't recommend their croissants at all."

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Kevin Geng,9 months ago, 5 stars ,"Cute new cozy place in bay and college. It is a bit pricy for the size the tea, coffee and cakes. I liked the experience and the taste. No complaints. But it didn't have anything newer or standing out from other cafes around. So I most likely won't go again."
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Michael Chang,9 months ago, 5 stars ,"I thought coffee shops are for people to grab a coffee, settle down and do work... until I found Neo Coffee Bar, which tries to get rid of their customers as quickly as possible from limiting wifi usage to 1 hr per day to enforcing a 'no-laptop' policy during peak hours. If you despise customers sticking around why open a coffee shop of all things?"

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Negar Shahrokh,9 months ago, 3 stars ,"(Translated by Google) Hojicha Tea/Latte is delicious. It is recommended to go ice-free without sugar.

I got sakura cake and there was no sweet in it, felt like I was eating a sponge. and the price for that was not even that fair. If you want to try cold coffee with non-tasty cake, you should go visit this place."
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Johanna Zhang,9 months ago, 4 stars ,I ordered a hot latte but unfortunately it was not very hot. By the time I sat down to drink my coffee it was almost cold. Their Sakura cake was also bland and tasteless. The place has a nice atmosphere but I won’t be coming back here anytime soon.

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Z C,9 months ago, 5 stars ,"Coffee is drinkable, and cookies are good. Bizarre seating inside that forces you to straddle a bar to sit in front of a tiny table. It has some outlets for plugging in laptops, but tables are so tiny it's nearly impossible to work on the tables."

I got the london fog latte, as it is one of my favourites to get right now. It was perfectly sweet and with the right amount of foam. My friends got iced hojicha and iced genmaicha, with a side of their sakura cake. Everything was just so cute. I really loved the aesthetic here!"

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Asma S.,10 months ago, 3 stars ,"Brewed coffee was pretty good, a little on the acidic side. The Sakura and Matcha lattes were quite nice, but I felt like the matcha flavour was lacking, slightly on the weaker side. The cherry blossom flavour was overpowered by the raspberry and ultimately just tasted like a raspberry latte with a hint of Sakura, and was a little too sweet for me. Overall for my first time there I did enjoy everything"
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Hélène B,10 months ago, 5 stars ,"I love Neo coffee bar! The first time I went there, I had a matcha that was recommended by a colleague. It was also my first time tasting matcha. It was so delicious and flavourful! The place is also really well designed. There was a coat rack near by to hang the coats and mufflers and it made sitting and chatting very comfortable! The staff is really courteous. I would highly recommend this place :)"

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,J.,10 months ago, 5 stars ,I tried Neo at their other location before this one and I like both! It's a great cafe for a quick coffee or place to catch up with a friend. I got their Iced Americano and Sakura short cake. Coffee was very smooth👌The cake was soft and not overly sweet! 👍 The interior had a lot of seating options with some large tables for groups and lots of small tables for individuals or duos. They also had a lot of outdoor seating.

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Real Reviews,11 months ago, 4 stars ,"No more pour overs.  Instead, poorly crafted weakened blend coffee.  It’s a shame because they used to be a great place for regular coffee with premium beans.  Now, you need to just have an espresso or milk based espresso coffee which is basically the same as everywhere else.  Normal.

I used to drive half way across town to get here.  No point anymore."

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Conrad Chan,11 months ago, 2 stars ,"(Translated by Google) This coffee shop located on Bay St in downtown Toronto is actually a branch. I remember going to the old shop in the early years. It is near George Brown College, and the old shop is relatively small.
This branch has a lot of atmosphere. As soon as you enter the store, you can feel the atmosphere of Japanese simplicity. Vertical grain wood strips are used as wall decoration, which is beautiful, chic and tasteful. There are enough guests, and the characteristic wooden table with log design is very large, and the whole feeling is very comfortable.
The cashier area is big enough, and the clerk is busy making coffee.
The eye-catching ones are colorful Japanese cake desserts. The roll cake selection is mouth-watering, and I immediately ordered a piece of [Maple Walnut Roll Cake] and added a cup of latte. Sit down and enjoy!
The cake looks good, the cream is not too sweet, and the taste is okay. The latte is smooth!
❇️In general, I feel that both the environment and the production are pretty good. Many people take out desserts, next time you can try puffs and other Western-style buns. Good looks are pleasing to the eye!

位于多伦多市中心Bay St的这家咖啡店其实是分店，记得早年去过老店，在george brown学院附近，老店地方比较小。
这分店大气很多。进店就感受到日式简约风的氛围。竖纹木条作为墙上装饰，好看、别致有味道。客座也足够多，原木设计的特色木桌很大，整个感觉很舒适。
收银区够大，店员忙碌地冲咖啡。
亮眼睛的是颜色缤纷的日式蛋糕甜点。卷蛋糕选择让人垂涎，立马点了块［枫糖核桃卷蛋糕］，加杯拿铁。坐下好好享受！
蛋糕卖相不错，奶油不太甜，口感还可以。拿铁香滑！
❇️总体觉得无论环境或出品都挺不错。不少人外卖甜点，下次可试试泡芙类和其他西式包点。颜值高就是讨好！"
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Dennis Kwan,11 months ago, 5 stars ,"Cute experience, but a couple of hiccups that made the visit regrettable.

Ordered a muffin and a slice of cake. Got two muffins and the wrong cake (wondered why the bill was more expensive than anticipated). What really threw me off were the employees doing food prep in the back while also texting on their phones 🤢"

I see not everybody agrees with the no-devices policy at certain times and the limited wifi, but I see it as a great and necessary way to keep customers moving and not taking up a seat for hours after buying one coffee. Even with those policies, it can be hard to find a seat with all the people using their laptops."
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,May Nguyen,a year ago, 5 stars ,"I first got introduced to NEO at their Frederick St location, which was great. However, the location on bay is completely OVERTAKEN by students (who are there just for how pretty the place is) to the point where one can’t drink their coffee in peace or even study/work. Service depends on who you’re being served by but overall it’s decent. The food and drinks are good and I love how they differentiate themselves from other coffee shops.

The staff is nice and helpful.
The place is very stylish and cozy, great atmosphere. I like the fact there's lots of light thanks to the bay windows. I do prefer this location compared to the other one on Fredrick str for this reason.
I just wish the tables of the seats around the wall where larger.

Also, they do have a changing table in the washroom, which makes a big difference if you're a parent and come with your baby 🚼

Highly recommend!"

But then no one feels offended because I am using a laptop! Please. This is nothing about customer and nothing about coffee. You just want to have a higher turnover and don’t want people to sit long. Say it out loud. I want more money. You should feel shamed and embarrass, but that’s how you should feel when you have a disgusting business policy.

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Alejandro Meraz,a year ago, 5 stars ,"One of my favorite places to grab coffee in the city. The coffee is wonderful and flavourful and they have a wide variety of coffee and tea based drink for those who want something else. The desserts are lovely and cute as well, I'd recommend their Lemon tarts or their Cookie choux. This is a pricy place so Id say maybe don't go everyday, it will break your bank. The tables are insanely small (with the exception of one large table) so don't even think about going their to do work or study. it gets quite busy, so you'll have to be lucky when looking for a table too. If you can grab a seat, the environment is great and it's the perfect place to chat with a new friend or catch up with an old one."

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,C Ha,a year ago, 5 stars ,"this was a great place for a very long time. But since abolition of covid restrictions, they have overhauled with new staff. Understandably. The quality of the coffee has correspondingly dropped significantly. Little treats and pastries are still good but coffee is now horrible. With time I'm sure the baristas will learn but for now, 3 stars is all we can muster."

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Janet Yao,a year ago, 4 stars ,"I am a local here, so I used to go here alot. I can't even count how many times I visited this place. I used to love this place and  their coffee and I still love it, but I had several unpleasent experiences these days.

Their baristas were used to be polite and nice, but now they've changed. I asked for an iced americano and the barista didn't hear it right so they made a wrong coffee (an iced latte). I was okay with that and asked to make it again for me. But they never apologized or asked for a refund unless I told them to. I know it is just a few dollars but this is not right.. You should've gone ahead and asked your customer first that you charged more because you got wrong orders.
I got a refund and paid a right amount again, but the fact that I had to raise this up by myself without hearing any apologies from them is very disappointing.

I went this place a week later again to grab a coffee but the lady who worked there was not polite and nice at all. She was just staring at me when I stood in front of the cashier to order. What an awkward moment! She didn't asked me what to orser so I just told her my drinks and food. She didn't say a word...I don't feel welcomed in this place anymore and feel ignored. I understand that people have bad days, busy days or whatsoever but you should not bring your mood to your workplace and express that feelings to your customers. That's very unprofessional. I might not go back to this place for a while and instead will go to Jimmy's because their staffs are great and very professional."

However, it was pretty busy when I came here on a Saturday afternoon. There were only 2-3 staff working in the cafe so the service was really slow, especially the cashier and the girl who was taking orders wasn’t very polite. Also, I asked to get the outside table cleaned but they never did."

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Aidan Spring,2 years ago, 4 stars ,Got Uber Eats. Good quality and super tasty. My Tiramisu didn't make it standing upright and smooshed. Unfortunately NEO uses plastic shards on top of this cake labeling them. That got smooshed into the cake and got lodged in my throat. Really not a pleasant experience. Plastic labels should not go onto a pastry that is made to eat. I am still giving NEO a 4 star because I believe their things are tasty. But the Tiramisu was poorly executed. I hope you stop using plastic labels on top of food! You could really hurt someone with these practices.

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Thays Brenner dos Santos,2 years ago, 5 stars ,"This location is near my workplace, so I make weekly visits. What really stands out to me at this location above every other cafe in the area is the service. Every visit is met with a warm, friendly welcome. The baristas give their undivided attention to each person who comes to the store, even if they are busy! It also doesn't take long for them to prep orders. They seem to be welcome to trying out customizations (provided that you aren't expecting extra ingredients for free of course). They sell coffee and a variety of Japanese teas, as they are a Japanese café, by the cup and by the package. I personally enjoy the Kabusecha, and Iced Matcha/Hojicha Lattes with their Housemade Vanilla Syrup. They sell a few Japanese-inspired pastries, like croissants, cookies, muffins, with Japanese flavours like matcha, yuzu, etc. While they are good, none of them stand out to me. In terms of more filling food, they do sell sandwiches. Having tried their selection several times, I can confirm that I do not really like them as I find them to be too salty."
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Carolina Rodriguez,2 years ago, 5 stars ,"Extremely slow and unorganized service....ordered 2 drinks 15min ahead of time, app said order was ready for pick up, showed up and they said they hadn’t started the order and need another 10min. There weren’t even that many customers in the store and three people working...the latte and London fog were also extremely watered down. Skip this place"

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,John,2 years ago, 5 stars ,"only place in the city with a genmaicha latte - highly reccomended! the toasted rice gives the drink a very rich savory depth. they also have all sorts of milk alternatives. i like that they change their desserts each month too. if they ever bring back the matcha molten lava cake - get it ASAP. their roll cakes have a luxurious mouthful - pistachio and black sesame especially.

my one complaint is that their cookies are dreadfully dry. i've been searching for the best matcha cookies and their matcha cookies are so far from ideal."

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Shim Mannan,2 years ago, 5 stars ,"I love Neo!

Tried a lot of pastries and coffee/tea lattes from this place over the past year thanks to covid.

Recommend:
1. Hojicha tea latte. A lot of reviewers mention matcha but hojicha is wayy better than matcha. Their hojicha is pretty solid and authentic.
2. Espresso. Their beans are delicious and baristas know how to pull a perfect shot.
3. Cookies
Matcha cookies and dark chocolate sea salt! If you don't like overly sweet cookies, you will love cookies from Neo!

Not sure:
Roll cakes- so inconsistent when it comes to quality???? Sometimes they are amazing sometimes they are soggy and gross. Hope they can do betty quality control?
Choux: dry and tasteless. Sorry 🥲... I wanted to love them."

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Matcha Snob,2 years ago, 4 stars ,"Pricey, IG-able Japanese style coffee shop.
INSIDE: Very few empty sits, tables are quite small (for 2 cups of coffee, or 1 laptop), not for big group.

MENU: very cute roll cakes, croissants & other pastries. Roll cakes are not that good, a bit DRY. But the Tiramisu is very creamy and refreshing.
*** They have new special menu every month.

DRINKS: the Matcha Latte I ordered is a bit plain, couldn't taste the matcha flavor in it. Not bad but nothing special.

OVERALL: good place to sit down & chat with ONE friend (not a group), but pastry & drinks are not special & a bit pricey.

* Fun fact: the place's belong to the same Kinka, Kinton Family"

It is a very earth tone vibe restaurant that has mini round single person study table. This location is quite popular and may get crowded but if you go early enough you will definitely get some peaceful time to yourself or a nice date with your significant other. I will always recommend this place and definitely visit again.

The only downside I can think of is that the prices are on the expensive side compared to other cafes. If they lower the price of their food items, it’s definitely a place to beat in downtown Toronto."

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Mina T.,3 years ago, 5 stars ,"The original Neo in downtown remains one of the best shops in Toronto but somehow the flavours are not replicated here in Bay st area. The coffee technique is great but the beans this store has chosen tend to disappoint: a mild musty flavour. The foods as always are ludicrously overpriced..a tiny sliver of a salmon and tomato sandwich for 8.95 which in reality with taxes and tips is 12 bucks. I can get the entire loaf of bread, a bunch of tomatoes, and pickles and sauce for less than that price :) Some practical pricing wouldn’t hurt get more people consuming these things. Anyway good to have options in the hood but it’ll be nice to have better coffee beans."

This cafe is located super close to downtown core, and they have a nice seating area for everyone for find a cute little table for themselves and study.

I also love their amazing pastries selection and handcrafted dessert cake rolls as well~ especially their monthly specials! I didn't get to try the cakes but ingot the spinach and feta pastry which was super super delicious! They warmed it up by request so I definitely recommend to warm it up for a crisp texture

Kyoto Matcha Latte - $5.95
Spinach and Feta Pie"
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Jensen,3 years ago, 4 stars ,"Cute Japanese coffee shop! Love the clean and minimal aesthetic. Beautiful cafe for IG photos esp. since they have pretty big windows so the lighting is pretty good. Compared to their other location, this one seems much busier and there aren't as many seats so would recommend going during off hours to avoid the crowd or be prepared to wait a bit for a spot. I've tried quite a few of their pastries and cakes and don't think there have been any that I disliked but their monthly specials are much more memorable than their daily pastries and cakes. Neo is on the pricier side, but I think it's worth it given the quality and atmosphere.

On my most recent trip, I got their March special, the matcha yuzu tiramisu. It was absolutely delicious!  The yuzu takes center stage for this dessert; the matcha is more subtle and adds a nice earthiness to complement the tart flavour from the yuzu and sweetness from the cream. Love how the yuzu cuts the heaviness of the cream and adds such a refreshing flavour! Perfect dessert to celebrate the warm Spring weather! My only complaint is the size... I wish it was triple the size! Could eat at least three cups of these!  So yummy! ⁣

Highly recommend Neo!"

The coffee has burnt taste, which is ususally noticeable with the cheap coffee variations.
The Matcha Tea is only sweetened, very small and overpriced (over 6$).
The stuff is not cooperative. When asked to change the order, every small tweak has to be paid for.
The weekends reserved for non-laptop time, so it is impossible to study... and even during other days, the tables are a size of a pea.

NEVER recommend"
