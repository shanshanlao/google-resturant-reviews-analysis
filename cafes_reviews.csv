Bud's Coffee,Queen St E,dave deece,9 months ago, 1 star ,The drip coffee was gross. Tasted like luke warm salt water. I ended up throwing it out.
Bud's Coffee,Queen St E,Christy Escanga,10 months ago, 3 stars ,Expensive coffee ..I got a cortado and I was expecting the nice strong and soft taste characteristic of a good cortado; instead I got a bitter coffee. It might be the kind of coffee they use?? The long line outside of the store is kin if deceiving. Maybe other coffee in the menu taste better.

We had a coffee there every morning, and each coffee was consistently good! Their iced coffee was also exactly how I like it, and not overly sweetened like Starbucks!
If you're ever in the area, this is definitely the best place to get coffee!"
Bud's Coffee,Queen St E,Natalie Taylor,a year ago, 5 stars ,"This is ""the local"" coffee shop and during COVID, they've made a coffee take-out window pretty charming. Whether you're getting a coffee or a pastry, service is fast and friendly. Perfect excuse to take your drink on a walk to the beach down the street."
Bud's Coffee,Queen St E,K K,a year ago, 3 stars ,"Cute walk up coffee spot in the Beaches. The downside is there‚Äôs no patio or seating area so it‚Äôs a grab and go spot. I tried the drinks so can‚Äôt speak to the food/snacks.

They charge extra for iced drinks which doesn‚Äôt seem necessary as it‚Äôs the same drink with a few iced cubes."

When I bring friends to The Beach and/or Toronto, I always bring them here. It speaks for itself.  Bud‚Äôs provides superb quality drinks in a relaxed and inviting neighbourhood atmosphere. Ken, Sarah, Rose, Kyle and Ryan and rest of the gang all produce excellent espresso.  Whenever I travel outside of Toronto and have espresso at other far flung locales, I realize some of the best espresso simply comes from my own neighbourhood in the Beach. The shop emulates everything that is so wonderful and soulful about this neighbourhood. Just simple good wholesome espresso. No gimmicks here."

They have been open several seasons but are now in a new location slightly more east on Queen St. (closer to Lion On The Beach) BONUS *** this new location is bigger and has allowed them to set up more tables and a cute play space for kids under three

Bud's Coffee,Queen St E,jim bradley,4 years ago, 1 star ,"Very rude!, was a daily customer. Showed up christmas eve for my daily latte at 730 , no holiday hours posted. The young man working inside saw me standing there and we made eye contact 3 times over 15 minutes. Finally i knocked on the door to ask the hours and he came out and told me 8 oclock. You would think if you saw a customer standing out front that you would take 30 seconds out of your day to let them know when they can come in.

i will not return"

Bud's Coffee,Queen St E,A Cartier,4 years ago, 4 stars ,"I feel like the Beaches are purposely keeping Bud's under wraps and not letting anyone know about this spot. I had no idea about Bud's and was dreading of finding a good cup in a new spot. With the overwhelming positives for this spot, I stepped into their door and was happy to Sam James beans being used.

Recently, it sounds like they moved to a bigger spot and still making a great cup. It is still very busy... even on a lazy Saturday afternoon, there was no tables freed up and the constant line up was in and out of the place. It has a great friendly vibe and everyone here is quite warm with each other. It's clear that Bud's has made themselves part of the community because of the number of personal conversations between patrons or the staff and patrons. This was really nice to see. I guess Toronto can be friendly after all!

I have to appreciate how they use the good Canadian brands like Pluck and Cut Coffee to create their drinks. Nothing like supporting a good local. I think the baristas really know their drinks cause the flat whites we got were surpassing some of the well known coffee shops that sit on Toronto top 50.

Flat White with almond milk - The butter knife beans are just so good and Bud's did them right. This was a rich and robust coffee flavour with a touch of milkiness from the microfoamed milk. No acidity to make me wince. We decided to do the cashew and almond milk side by side taste test. I personally liked the almond milk more. I found it didn't influence the flat white as much and let the coffee flavour be more forward. I liked this one. 4/5

Flat White with cashew milk - I found the cashew milk version to have less of a coffee flavour... it definitely changed the taste. I would say it was a milkier flavour but more muted for sure. I did find cashew milk to be creamier than the almond milk but also weirdly enough, I touch more sweet? So if you're looking for the texture the most closest to cow's milk, this would probably be your favourite alternative milk. Kudos to Buds for offering more than one type of nut milk. 4/5

If I'm far out east again, I'll definitely make Bud my choice to get a good flat white and happy I'm not stuck to Starbucks."

I think they recently increased their prices and the menu on their website might be out of date.
I don't feel like what I got was worth it. After tax and 15% tip, my club sandwich and side minestrone soup was $26. Inflation hitting hard!

Very few options for people who are lactose intolerant or vegan as nearly all menu items have cheese."

I wouldn‚Äôt eat any of the food. If you‚Äôre disabled, green or naive definitely keep on looking for a job, it‚Äôs not worth it - this couple will be mean to you and/or take advantage."
Juice & Java Cafe,Queen St E,Maliha K.,3 months ago, 3 stars ,"Not too bad, if I‚Äôm being honest not my FAVOURITE coffee shop on the beaches because I feel like the coffee is sometimes not fresh and the matcha drinks are 98% milk and 2% matcha. I do however love the service and their baked stuff, brownies and cookies are great here!! If you‚Äôre looking to get their salads though I would probably not.. there‚Äôs better salad other places around. Great customer service though, super friendly people, just not too good for their actual drinks :( Not worth the price, sorry!!"
Juice & Java Cafe,Queen St E,Jim W,3 months ago, 3 stars ,It's fine. Been here twice and the food is not worth the price but it was fine. The crepe menu looks good but the sandwich board is approaching fine dining prices for basic sandwiches. It seems to be busy with an older local clientele. The way their stock is stored is quite odd. It was very clean but cluttered in layout.

The drink itself tasted fine and I don‚Äôt like to post negative reviews for independent owned shops... but the Nutella crepe was disgustingly sweet and the strawberries were not fresh. I thought it would be fresh considering it was a $10 crepe - but I can tell when it‚Äôs defrosted frozen strawberries. Because of the strawberries, I had to write a review to let others manage their expectations.

Also if management is reading this, you need to go easy on the Nutella."

It's silly. And given the price you charged for it, a pickle or a bit of coleslaw on the side would have made up for the bland cheese. I wish I knew what cheese that was, so I'll remember never to buy it..  And to top it off,  you served it in a cereal bowl. Really?"

Juice & Java Cafe,Queen St E,Ronak Dhanak,4 years ago, 5 stars ,The coffee here tastes different than most of the other coffee shops.. probably the beans that they use. I found the coffee stronger yet subtle and more earthy. Along with the  coffee we had the vegetable sandwich (rye bread) and the carrot muffin. The sandwich was extremely fresh and the bread was good..but what needs to be commended is the carrot muffin- absolutely delicious. The place is spacious with a wonderful team and even has a little library of its own. An excellent  choice to sit back and let the weariness dissolve!

Or just bad pop. Too much noise. Please create a mood and ambience."

Juice & Java Cafe,Queen St E,Jazzy B.,4 years ago, 4 stars ,"(Translated by Google) We went there twice in the summer to buy coffee and pastries. The food and drinks have always been high quality, tasty and well made. I found the wait to be a bit long, and there was only one waitress. In addition, the shop is quite expensive, hence a star deduction. Otherwise great.

I also had an iced hazelnut vanilla coffee. They offer their coffees and teas as hot or iced for same price. Looking at their extensive menu on the wall, they also serve crepes, omelets, sandwiches, and some other standard baked goods which are all baked from scratch in store."

Good quality and good value. You won't be disappointed. Internet wasn't working, can't tell you if it was a random thing. The heat was definitely not working well. The place had some space heaters but it was quite cold. Again, I'm not sure if it was a random thing or just the norm. It was quite uncomfortable, and since the number of space heaters I suspect it was not so random. There was ice on the inside of the window. Perhaps I was just out of luck."

The smoothies are made with real fruits and no sugar added which is good. Their crepes are really well done topped with your choice of toppings. The Italian wedding soup is great.

Juice & Java Cafe,Queen St E,Dario E.,7 years ago, 1 star ,"Wanted to like this place because of the atmosphere (it's cozy which is the only plus), however, on several occasions that I have come here they have been out of basic ingredients - juices, breads, milks. The staff are also very forgetful -had to remind them a few times of my order and that I was waiting. Today I ordered my first ""meal"". 9$ (plus tip). For the sandwich, they used the last bottom pieces of the bread (you know the tiny pieces at the front and end of a loaf of bread?) and gave me 4 pieces saying they were mini sandwiches. Not to mention they were over toasted/slightly burnt to the point where biting down to them cut my gums. I literally could have made this sandwich at home for less than I paid. It's really a shame because the atmosphere is nice but that does not excuse them from delivering good food. it just is not somewhere I would ever recommend a friend to go to if they wanted a decent sandwich... or smoothie apparently (refer to the other 1 star review)."
Juice & Java Cafe,Queen St E,Kirsten Visima,7 years ago, 1 star ,"Worst smoothie ever! I asked for a Berry Mango smoothie with almond milk and I got a very weak tasting drink with barely any fruit and extremely pail in colour.  I had trouble believing any berries were even used because the drink was so pale. Last time I checked strawberries were RED and mangos are ORANGE so why was my smoothie almost colourless??? I quickly came back with my smoothie to complain, and  the response I got from the guy behind the counter was so disappointing. He shrugged his shoulders and said ""sorry"". Claimed he put berries in it and that was the end of the conversation. Didn't do anything to rectify the situation. For the hefty price that it cost, (PLUS TIP!!!) I was expecting a whole lot better of a response. Hell, a scoop of berries would have been enough. Worst customer service ever. Will never go back."

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Ryan Magder,8 months ago, 2 stars ,"Stopped by for Father's day around 10am.  Sign outside the restaurant mentioned a 25-minute wait for food, no problem, we continued on in and got a table with no issue. After ordering we waited an hour for food. Food arrived cold (eggs, bacon, sausages, potatoes), we ate it because we were starving at that point, understanding that if we sent it back we would likely be waiting a long time for the food to return.

Manager (we assume, she is decision maker for hiring) asks how the food was. Gave her our honest feedback about the long wait and food quality, I'm honestly not sure how the food could arrive cold unless it was sitting at the window for a while. For what it's worth, the service was good and we were able to get refills on our drinks (2nd star for service).

I understand restaurants being understaffed (sure, it happens!), but I'd rather that they communicate it realistically beforehand (i.e., write on the sign out front the wait for food is 45 minutes - 1 hour). We heard other nearby tables with small children asking about the arrival of their food. We were told they'd give it 200% next time, no amendments to the bill were made. Sorry, there will probably not be a next time."

I was fine to leave it at that and not review but I asked for a refill on my coffee in a to go cup and after paying for my bad meal in full, she told she would have to ring up a new coffee.

I told her not to bother and would tell anyone reading this also not to bother.

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Michael Loyst,8 months ago, 2 stars ,"Really disappointed. $15 breakfast and this is the portion they give for bacon. That was after waiting nearly 30 minutes for food. Eggs were delicious, bacon was clearly a low sodium version and tasteless."

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Breanne Marie Peacock,9 months ago, 5 stars ,"I love The Beacher Cafe. Growing up in the Beaches, I went here often with friends and family. I stopped by on Victoria Day to show some family outside of Toronto the Beaches. We sat on the patio to enjoy desserts and coffees. Namely, we really enjoyed the cr√®me br√ªl√©e and cheese cake. The service was very friendly. I would always recommend someone to stop by. If you‚Äôre looking for breakfast or brunch, my personal favourites are the eggs Benedict and their big traditional breakfast."

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,John Andrews,9 months ago, 1 star ,"I've been going to The Beacher for some time but the last couple of visits there have been sub par. The interior in winter months tends to be below room temperature, but more than that, the portions have become noticeably smaller, particularly the home fries with the eggs benedict - easily half the size the order was previously. The past two times have been bad experiences. One we waited almost an hour for our food which was also disappointing and yesterday, May 20, we tried again and my wife's omelette was stone cold, as were her home fries. We complained the the waitress took it back to the kitchen and when it returned, yes it was hot but flavourless. She said the best tasting part of her meal was the toast. That's it Beacher... we're done. Never coming back... lots of other places in the Beach that would be happy to have our business and give us value for money. AVOID"

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Timothy Ho,9 months ago, 3 stars ,"Servers were friendly and efficient. The food was nothing exceptional but fair. Was a bit concerned when I heard somebody‚ÄîI assume the owner‚Äîscolding one of the servers for doing something incorrectly.

The bill was also a bit of a surprise with their made up ‚ÄúInflation‚Äù tax. Mixed feelings about this considering their prices were already a bit high for what we got.

Overall, great service, food ok."
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Justin Aubut,9 months ago, 5 stars ,I made and delivered 2 picnic tables for this restaurant and the owner gave me and my son free lunch. It was without a doubt the best brie burger I have ever had! Definitely going to take the whole family next time. Thanks Peter!

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Teresa Zhang,9 months ago, 5 stars ,"Hey Bleacher Cafe, went there today, and loved the food as per usual, great atmosphere, however I have noticed an extra ""inflation"" charge on the bills.  I totally get it, with current economic environment and inflation on everything, it is necessary to charge clients the extra amount to ensure your restaurant's survival.  However the only suggestion is perhaps to make a note on the menu stating the % charged to stay a float or have your friendly waiting staff to inform the table. I would be happy to pay for it, it just came to me on my bill as a surprise a had no idea how much was being charged.  Other than that, I am happy to be a patron again at your establishment, b/c I love that quiche you served today.  Thank you!! Would be happy to join the restaurant again soon!"

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Emily Robertson,9 months ago, 2 stars ,"Came for my partners birthday for a quick brunch and was definitely a bit of a subpar experience.

Food was alright but not great for the price. Eggs in my order were made incorrectly, and I had to send them back sadly. The home fries are huge chunks of soft potato, some not even cut. The bacon and eggs were extremely oily‚Ä¶ a bit disappointing.

Our server was nice, and tried to be as accommodating as possible, but she seemed really frazzled. She had to drag around a huge sandwich board with the specials with her all over the restaurant? We felt bad she had to do that just to tell us the specials‚Ä¶ ??

Lastly a few feet away from us on a table in our section was a huge box of cat litter‚Ä¶ so strange. Definitely weird to have out during brunch service."

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Bran Thayalaseelan,10 months ago, 2 stars ,"This place should exist under different ownership or management. A breakfast diner of this sort is much needed in the neighborhood but not one that is as poorly managed.
I guess I'm viewing this more as a restaurant entrepreneur than a patron. The food program is actually not terrible so that's why they don't receive a 1 star review from me (which I so badly want to give)."
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,da Pat,11 months ago, 4 stars ,"There are Diners and there are breakfast places. Breakfast places add a little something extra that makes the food tastier, surrounding cozier, and service a notch friendlier.

When we finally received our order it was the wrong order (another table), then when our order came I had the wrong side... And their prices are a bit too much for a brunch place. Not going back for sure."

They answered all our questions about the menu and food came fresh, hot, and plentiful. I enjoyed the Eggs Benjamin. My family were enthusiastic about the fries (crispy and creamy inside) and the cajun chicken caesar. I highly recommend this Beach landmark"

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Matthew Stevens,a year ago, 2 stars ,"Used to go here alot many years ago, and wanted to try it again. Very disappointed that they have no vegan options at all, and only two vegetarian options (one of which is an overpriced, basic grilled cheese). It would be so easy to offer all their burgers with the option of a veggie burger patty instead, and then they'd have several more vegetarian options at least. Or even a breakfast option that didn't include meat. I know you can get the current options without meat, but you're still paying for it."

We waited well over an hour for our meal to arrive. We were told that the steak was taking a while to cook. We were told that the BLT on a croissant would have to be on bread because they ran out of croissants. This was about 40 minutes after we had ordered it. People who arrived after us were being served long before us and several had even paid and left while we were waiting for our food. We were presented with bills that were full price. When we said we would not pay the full amount after waiting so long, we were brought bills that were 25% off. We asked to speak to a manager but we‚Äôre told no manager was working that day. We will not be returning which is hard because we know how much people are counting on getting back to normal"

We will never forget when we first moved in the neighbourhood, this is the first place we went to and in excitement in sharing that we just bought our new home, the owner treated our entire family to ice cream and said ""welcome to the neighbourhood.""  The small gesture meant so much to us as it was so genuine. Over the years, as our child was born we always felt so welcomed there and Ashely (our favourite server) had such a warm, natural rapport with our little guy and as he grew older in his tots they would always wave to eachother as they passed by. We really appreciate the community feels you create for your customers. To us you are family! Thank you for your excellence in customer service and your kindness."
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Dana Garden,2 years ago, 3 stars ,"Have enjoyed many breakfasts at the Beacher Cafe but have recently noticed that although the price of the menu stays the same, but the qualitty of the meals have not.  Especially the Healthy Breakfast that included a choice of avocado or cottage cheese.  The last 3 times we have been at the Beacher Cafe to support the local businesses, we have been told that the avocado is no longer available.  If the avocado is no longer available, then the price should either be lower or offer an additional poached egg.  That's my opinion!"

.
The food was great. We tried the all day breakfast, avocado egg benedict special, chocolate mousse cake, and an apple crumble cheesecake. Our server was exceptionally friendly, as were the other servers who checked in to provide refills of coffee or water and remove our plates.
.
The restaurant is very family-friendly. There were groups of seniors, parents with young children, couples on dates, and even a group of younger women out to brunch together. It was very welcoming and the overall experience was simply comforting.
.
I would definitely recommend stopping in to try one of their specials next time you're on Queen Street East!"

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Paul Andrusiak,3 years ago, 5 stars ,"This restaurant is in the ‚ÄòBeaches‚Äô, a very popular and beautiful neighbourhood. We were next to a large window by the street that offered a nice view. We came for brunch and I ordered Eggs Benedict. The menu said they were known for their famous hollandaise sauce. The food was great, coffee too (which is normally not the case at restaurants). Service was casual and nice but perfectly attentive when something was needed. Overall, I would eat here every morning if I could."

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,HeavenlyHund,3 years ago, 1 star ,Food cold poor service 12.00 for cold chesse sandwiches and frys no salad dressing asked 3 people before I received it and never asked what kind I wanted. Veggie Burger good but forget onions and mushrooms brought in side dish cold. 150.00 4 4 chesse sandwiches 1 veggie burger 4 drinks. Sandwich was supposed to be on Texas Toast and was on thin cheap wheat toast. Was excited drove from Niagara Falls very disappointed when we got there pleasant environment. When I expressed how cold all the food was how long were you had waited and that it was incorrect toast no offer of compensation was made or apology I noticed anybody that has a complaint here many restaurants come back on with the owner of a reason complaints an offer to try to make it up so you'll come back I need to find a new restaurant in the beaches I will never return and no matter how many good reviews they have here I should just people don't go there because I don't know why anyone would give him a the food was cold the portions were small the service was poor there was high and there was a fly right around our food the entire time and nobody turn on the ceiling fans on a warm summer day to distract the flies from bothering the food. All in all a disappointing an overpriced meal. No one mines paying for a meal if the food is good in the service is nice. The only thing I can say good about this restaurant is it was cute in the inside and had a lovely patio. Don't go there if you're a vegetarian or I suspect even a meat eater and you want a good meal. Feel free to go there if you want to pay $150 for a $30 meal but isn't great. The food and service was so bad that I feel compelled to leave a very rude review and go back and edit it and add more she feeling bad about my total experience.

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Jacqueline P,3 years ago, 2 stars ,"I had to send back my initial meal because the salad was literally swimming in a pool of oil, I just asked for a new salad with dressing on the side. I was brought a new plate and began eating to discover they had just put new salad atop the old, and the greens were literally rotting. The waitstaff was very apologetic, and it‚Äôs not her fault, but this is unacceptable for a restaurant of any kind."

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Cthrew,3 years ago, 2 stars ,"If it's a leisurely lunch you want, go someplace else.    Ordered a glass of white wine and began chatting with my friend.  Waiter approached three times within fifteen minutes to see if we were ready to order.  And the restaurant was close to empty!!!!!!  Ordered the tuna melts, just to get rid of the waiter.  Within five minutes he was back with the tasteless meal.  Barely luke warm melted cheese over flaked tuna on an English Muffin.  Sounds yummy.  It wasn't. Sat like a rock on my stomach because I was rushing to finish it so waiter could clear the table.  Was in and out within 40 minutes. Bad."
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Daniel Reynolds,3 years ago, 5 stars ,A very relaxing cafe just up from the beach. In my experience the cafe was never too busy and is spacious for any occasion. The food was fantastic with there being daily special boards to keep everything new. If you go in the morning Id recommend the eggs benedict and in the afternoon there brie burgers are ones not to miss out on. The staff are super friendly offering drinks at regular intervals.

It has a broad outdoor patio running along its front that allows you to people watch. It‚Äôs a good place to take the kids and in my experience, it is in unusual for my coffee cup to run empty.

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Amy Tam,3 years ago, 1 star ,My rating is based on the 15 mins I was there waiting for a table at the door. It wasn't busy at all and the servers were walking slowly around all angry and annoyed. We watched two argue and it was just a disaster. We over heard people saying their orders were wrong. People went up to pay and a server yelled at them when they asked for service. I think we dodged a bullet by leaving..

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Astrum Rimor,3 years ago, 2 stars ,"Ridiculously overpriced. The restaurant is cute and the fries were ok, but everything else was not very good. The benny has only two eggs but was more expensive than Sunset Grill (3 egg bennies), and much less tasty. Their ‚Äúfamous‚Äù hollandaise sauce was really weird and awful. It‚Äôs a strange colour and kind of clear, like it‚Äôs a lot of cream of tartar, and totally flavourless. I asked for an English muffin with the benny instead of a croissant but they gave me a croissant anyway and it was not a pleasant combo. The pancakes were also very bland. The amount of food they give you is TINY for the price."

The one star is for just about the worst dinner expereince ive ever had anywhere in the world. The worst service pure rudness and unprofessional. It was almost like they didnt want us to come in.

The food was such a pale comparsion to the breakfast/brunch they do, litterly night and day. I wish i remember to take a photo, i looked at the plate and just asked for the bill. I wanted to just walk out which i should have.  ""Soluvlaki chicken dinner"" The plate had 5 tiny pi√®ces of chicken spread out like islands and cold fries im guessing they we're frozen?!??? It looked frost burnt.

Finally No way the owner knows this is going on. No one in there right mind would run a restaurant like this on a street with such a high reputation."

My mom‚Äôs waffles were cold and my French toast had a bit of a garlic taste most likely due to an unclean grill. This is the second time I‚Äôve experienced slow service.

It's the sort of place where they remember you and bring kids  colouring books or your favourite drink. It's exactly what you need some days. While the menu is traditional and the food is pretty basic, it suits everyone's needs. We come here when we have a group, kids or people of various ages. They wisely pad their menu with multiple specials each day to keep things interesting.
It may not knock your socks off the first time you come, but it may become a favourite, cozy regular spot."

Unfortunately, you can hear across the restaurant when the owner is in the building by the way he yells horribly. I was literally looking for an escape route the 1st time I heard it, thinking a violent ex-employee was on a rampage in the kitchen. Charges for any and all substitutions really add up as well."

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,michael b,6 years ago, 1 star ,"I assume that most people go here for the all day breakfast and brunch stuff but my wife and I went  here on a weekday for lunch.  We ordered some pretty simple menu items which the waitress agreed were good choices.  But for drinks we thought we would try the smoothies.  Hilarious. These were more like slushees with a fake fruit flavour and no real sign of fruit that I could see.  The arches make better smoothies.    My wife had the fish and chips and I had the club sandwich which boasts ""real turkey"" as an ingredient.   Sadly when the sandwich came I was hugely disappointed.  Basically three pieces of ordinary brown toast with this really thinly slice turkey that was seared on the flat top.  The peameal bacon was very thin and seared as well.  Nice lettuce and tomato but an OK effort at best.  Not recommended.   The fries on my order were fresh but had an odd odour like cheap oil... not pleasant.   My wife's fish and chips looked ok but generally we like more fish than batter.  The fish seemed a bit underdone for me.  It is again an OK effort but not terribly good.   We were given glasses of water and asked if this was tap water.  Yup.. not filtered like most restaurants today.   Yuck.. undrinkable.
I am sure this place pleases the families who come here later in the morning but I would suggest this is not really a proper restaurant for a decent meal other than the all day breakfast stuff."

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Mary Casey,8 years ago, 2 stars ,"The food is ok. Mediocre. Value for ok food is low, because it's priced high for what you're getting. ex. simple 'not chunky' grilled chicken on a bun with what they call a salad (which is really a handful of mixed greens) is $14. If value was high for ok food, it wouldn't be as bad. But not even that. Portions not high either for low quality food."
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Julian Egelstaff,8 years ago, 5 stars ,"The specials are always good, and the regular menu is too. Breakfast, esp. Eggs Benedict and Benjamin, are super. Reliable, friendly, and close to the Beach."

The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,paulinezed,9 years ago, 4 stars ,"Not a place for fine dining, but it's a friendly place, and fantastic if you have kids.  They bring watermelon slices for the little ones while you decide on your order and there are colouring books and crayons available.  And the food is pretty good.  (Good pizza, and their tender calamari is a personal favourite.)"
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Brian Crockford,9 years ago, 4 stars ,
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Andrew Tischler,9 years ago, 4 stars ,A solid neighborhood restaurant that I always enjoy going to.  Great chicken on a bun and waffles on weekends.
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Pop Hill,9 years ago, 3 stars ,I would say the food is fair and certainly not a place for fine dining.  It basically just meets the minimum for a fair breakfast joint.
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Carlo Romano,10 years ago, 3 stars ,"(Translated by Google) for me the place wasn't bad, the decor is a bit funny, but it's full of places like that and the food was good, much better than other coolest places but with industrial food....

(Original)
per me il posto non era male, l'arredamento fa un p√≤ ridere, ma √® pieno di posti cos√¨ e il cibo era buono, molto meglio di altri posti pi√π fighi ma col cibo industriale...."
The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Christophe F.,10 years ago, 5 stars ,"Being a regular at this restaurant I've seen the best and the worst of the place. Currently it's in a good spot. The owners, the staff and the chefs will make everything in their power so you can have a great time. You don't like something? Send it back and tell what's your preference. You'll be surprised how a little communication can go a long way.
Wonderful pizzas, great chicken sandwiches and specials. The desserts from Dufflet are decadent with the best chocolate mousse around!
Amazing atmosphere especially during summer months. Highly recommended!"

The friendly gent brewing the bean made such a good Americano, I had to stay and have another. Second one was iced since it was so hot out, perfect.
I mentioned to him how I liked that it wasn‚Äôt very acidic, and he pointed out some of the reasons behind it, which were very cool to learn.
Followed that up with the mixed berry muffin I had been eyeing earlier. It had a PROPER amount of berries, which is just the way I like it.
Even managed to get a good amount of work and reading done while listening to the very chill jazz playing in the background.
I‚Äôll definitely make this a regular hangout on my days in town. There are two more muffins I‚Äôm eyeing for my next visit :D"

Remarkable Beans,Queen St E,Alejandra,10 months ago, 2 stars ,"Out of all the pretentious Queen street coffee shops this is one I would urge you not to go here.

I‚Äôve been here several times in the last couple of months because I wanted to give them a chance but nope, still the same awful service every time.

I was just there and the person serving me clearly had no interest in being there and shows no service etiquette. My standards are not high, but all I‚Äôm saying is I‚Äôve received better service at Burger King.

I give them 2/5 because at the very least they have a good selection of food which most coffee shops nowadays don‚Äôt seem to offer.

I would be happy to come back to this Queen staple if their staff integrated manners into work ethic and accepting cash would be a plus!"

Remarkable Beans,Queen St E,Nancy Macedo,3 years ago, 3 stars ,"Parking was tough to visit the Remarkable Bean. Our decision to still make attempts to stop and enjoy the coffee were based on other reviews and how highly other thought about the place. I found it really average. The place is cute and you can find seating but its awkward at times. I think the owner needs to review seating arrangements - there are definately ways to maximize space without compromising a cozy atmosphere. The coffee was good but was average. I got the rocket fuel coffee and a oatmeal cookie - just average and nothing else to write about. My guess is that its a good  neighborhood spot as it became a bit busy with 1 served who managed drinks, orders, and cash. However, I don't think I'll go out of my way again."

Remarkable Beans,Queen St E,Sydney Westgate,4 years ago, 5 stars ,"My family and I are frequent customers at the Bean both in Leslieville and the Beaches. Not only is the coffee AMAZING (they roast their own btw) but the desserts are delicious. I suggest trying the ButterTart, they are the best in town! They also have a wide range of gluten free products and some vegan which is nice to have :)

As I said before, the coffee is wonderful. The owner's, as well as one very charming barista with a mighty fine beard, roast their own beans in house. The coffee is strong, not acidic and smooth. Rocket Fuel is my go-to! The espresso is creamy with caramel undertones. Just by the taste of your drink, you know the roasting is done expertly and the staff are well trained when it come's to steaming milk and pouring espresso shots. The staff are also extremely friendly and quirky - don't let the sometimes sarcastic wit steer you away! The Remarkable Bean is certainly unique and the staff are no different. There is jazz music playing in the background and velvet purple, yellow and red pillows.

Everyone who goes to the Bean is also kind. You can certainly tell that in the Leslieville location, almost everyone is a regular and the owners are familiar with many of their customers. Speaking of the owners, the Bean is a family run company and if you are grabbing a coffee from either location you are bound to see them. They care about their store, their customers and their staff. They are, in my opinion, a very ""hallmark"" type of family and if you know hallmark, that means they are kind, charming and passionate about what they do.

If I was going to recommend a coffee shop in Toronto to someone, my first suggestion is always the Remarkable Bean! It may be located outside of the downtown core, but it's worth the trip! My family doesn't live in the area but still choose to swing by the bean when in need of a coffee-fix. Trust me when I say you can't go wrong :)

ALSO they have comedy on friday nights!! BONUS"

It's a cute, cozy small design that draws you in and encourages you to settle in and set up shop with a good book or your laptop for a few hours. It's snug, warm, and the wood features and exposed brick wall add a nice style to the place. What stood out the most to me at this shop was the warm atmosphere and the friendliness - not only of the staff, but also of the other patrons! I got excited when I saw it as I thought the name was very adorable, and wanted to take a picture in front of it - I tried to be quick and not block anyone's way but people were also so nice and understanding!"

One during this past summer; Iced tea was really good (they brew it as you order) but the staff seemed to be new and a bit unsure of them self. The drinks took a long time."

The Haven Low-Carb Cafe,Queen St E,Neilizza Silva,6 months ago, 5 stars ,"Good food, ok prices. Most of the keto products are expensive which is to be expected- but the quality does make up for it. The tiramisu they sell by ketolibriyum is absolutely amazing.

The only downside is it's a little too far away and way out of the way and the hours are too short so if you need to get something after a 9-5 job in downtown Toronto, store would be closed by then.

Would really help if they had delivery of some kind."

The owners are so friendly and welcoming, and seem to have a unique bond with many of their customers.

My favourite place to go now in the Beaches."

Today I stopped by early and picked up a few of their chorizo biscuits, cookies and cheesecake bar.  They recommended toasting the biscuit when I got home.  I did and they were amazing!!  Such great flavour.  The ginger cookie dipped in chocolate was delicious, loved it!  It was a thick, soft cookie with a great ginger flavour.  The cheesecake bar was another winner, loved the stewed blueberry topping.  Will definitely be going back to try other treats:)"

The chocolate croissant was nothing special. I recommend passing on the baked goods as this is the third item I have tried at Dineen that tasted like packaged baked goods. Not bad by any means but not worth the price.

Disappointed but cognizant that it is the Financial district so items everywhere are always a little marked up.

Ambiance is lovely and the decor is definitely nice! Good place for meeting a client or friend!"

This time, I got‚Ä¶.

‚òïÔ∏èCandamom Chai Latt√© ‚òïÔ∏è
I actually have not tried this latte, I was looking for something that has no sugar and the waiter recommended this to me! ü•∞It is one of my favourite now, I will definitely come back and get it again! ü§≠The Chai flavour is not as heavy as I thought it would be and every sip I drank was very soothing. üòãIf you are looking for something with no sugar but more on the milky side, this is definitely something you should try out! ü§†

üçã Lemon Poppyseed Loaf üçã
This was calling out to me, I am totally a fan of lemon poppyseed loaf. üòãTheir loaf was very yummy and rich in lemon flavour! It is more on the sweeter side and I wish there were more lemon flavour but totally loved it! ü§†

Other than Lattes, they also serve different coffees like flat white, Americano. üíïI have heard that their Matcha latte is very very good but they cannot do no sugar so I did not get to try this time! üëÄWill definitely come back for the Candamom Chai Latte!üòå

Thank you for yummy treats! ü§ç"
Mos Mos Coffee,Bay St,Maria Mejia,a month ago, 2 stars ,"I came to the coffee shop since I had a couple hours to spare and wanted to study and do some work. Their wifi has a bunch of sites blocked which meant I only had access to my email. All of my google docs were not accessible and my online drive for school was also not accessible. For the price of the coffee I would at least expect some basic wifi connection. When I spoke with the manager all she said was that she could not help and that its not their wifi thats the problem, that its probably the site or my computer. Which is not true due to me being able to access my work and school from my phone using my data and later being able to access it with no issues at another coffee shop. Clearly they don't care about customer experience."

I would have given them 5 stars but, the female behind the counter was not in a good mood...you're in the customer service business try to act like you like your job or at least be nice. When asked where the vegan donuts are don't just point, use your vocal chords. Anyways, the coffee was great; flavourful,  smoky and full of nutty and caramel notes and perfectly bitter.

I just think I visited on an off day for them. I love their drink selection and the variety of options for coffee and tea. The cookies are really delicious and fresh! I also loved how fluffy and big the vegan donut was. Although, I may have gotten the wrong flavour; I let them choose for me, and the one I received had a very tart, strong, sweet, fruitiness to it that just wouldn't sit right with me as I personally enjoy more mellow flavours. I also ordered the mango Chai latte with soy milk. That also didn't really work with me for similar reasons... but I will make another visit very soon and make some safer choices and adjust my review accordingly if the experience improves!"

Mos Mos is so much better than Starbucks! The service is outstanding as well. We were served by a tall, younger gentleman & he was very friendly, personable & informative. He recommended the salted Caramel Milk cookie & it was awesome! Great recommendation.

The place is very clean, functional & presentation is great too. I‚Äôll be back soon for the Mars bar cookie next! Excellent job Mos Mos! üíØ"

Mos Mos Coffee,Bay St,Claire Hoon,2 years ago, 5 stars ,"Easily some of the best chai lattes I've ever had! Lots of cafes with mediocre chai lattes go overboard with the cinnamon or the milk, but the ones here taste very balanced.

I had the cardamom and mango ones and they were both very delicious, with the rich taste of chai permeating the whole drink. I like how there's a complex aftertaste - you can taste the milk, the chai and your flavour of choice.

Note that the sugar level and toppings are adjustable, which is great for a little bit of customization. I personally found half sugar the right amount of sugar.

Also: my pickup order was packed with care and the staff was very friendly. 90% of cafes here don't give me a tray or paper bag unless I ask, but I got both without any prompting. Great service!"

Mos Mos Coffee,Bay St,Mandy Kuo,3 years ago, 1 star ,"On both December 19 and December 23, the cafe closed earlier than the posted business hours and this is really frustrating when people purposely stop by from the business tower at your store to get coffee and brought no jackets to go outside! Please follow the actual business hours on your website and Google."
Mos Mos Coffee,Bay St,Harmony Granger,3 years ago, 3 stars ,"The coffee isn't something that suites my tastes--if taken black, it is quite strong and bitter, without much acidity. However, the ice lattes and milky drinks tend to be very heavy on the milk, so much so that I cannot taste much of the coffee anymore. The nitro cold brew is not the best I've had either.
Their cookies have a crumbly, shortbread texture, rather than a chewy inside and crispy outside, so it's just a matter of preference.

The store itself is quite clean and bright. The service is okay, although the staff don't really appear to like answering questions if it is busy.  Overall, the coffees and pastries just don't really fit my tastes."

Ordered coffee with milk, got it with hot steamed milk which is a major plus. Coffee tasted great, strong enough but creamy with the milk. Pastries looked good, but not enough to have to buy one. Seating is decent but no plugs available to charge laptop."

I was a bit confused about the line up and ordering process. I think anyone who goes there for the first time will be confused. They should provide better signs and system. So you have to pick a cup size and stick the type of beverage first and then go to the barista.
Very cool concept but most new customers will be lost.
Staff were nice and explained the process. I will go back to try the lattes! This location closes at 6 btw. The cardamom latte is amazing! I tried the turmeric latte and didn't like it  .made.it was made well.. just  not my taste.

New update:
I don't recommend any matcha beverage/product from here. I tried a few times and was disappointed."

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Fatima A.S,3 weeks ago, 4 stars ,"I've been to this location  many times the last 3 years. I have to say the quality of food and drinks has gotten better. It is a Japanese style cafe. They offer matcha lattes, roll cakes, cheesecakes, pastries, and lunch options. I usually stop by for a quick drink and pastry.

During the pandemic, I felt that the espresso based drinks were watery and pastries were stale. But after 2 visits in the last 30 days, I can say that the quality has improved significantly. I had a decaf latte, and the espresso was full-bodied and aromatic. I ordered a croissant, and it was soft, buttery, and fresh. I observed that their pastries were made in-house because I saw two bakers actively working away. I'm glad they have worked on their products, and it is reflected in their quality.

My total for a latte and croissant came up to $10, which is going to be pricey for some, but it is the norm for downtown coffeeshops. They have narrow bench style seating along the cafe and a community table. It can become busy and crowded, and the entrance area can be packed. Making it difficult to find seating or figure out which line to stand in to place an order.

On the bonus side, they have a ""Happy hour"" of their own for house made drinks.  You get 50% off the same drink that you ordered earlier in the day. You just have to have your copy of the receipt as proof."

The inside of the store is pretty spacious and clean. They have tables and seats on the side walk. The location is good for university students and office works but not ideal for drivers. I would visit if I want to socialize and treat myself or a friend.
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Francesca Norte,a month ago, 4 stars ,"I give them 4 stars as the coffee and dessert I had were really good and the vibe was really nice. Definitely a good place to chat and catch up with friends over cafe drinks and Japanese inspired desserts. Service was also really nice and the washroom is kept clean.

They lose a star as they really don‚Äôt encourage any kind of laptop work which is evident in the way the space is designed as well as how their wifi works.

Majority of the tables are small and can only fit a laptop. They have one large table space if you need to use a mouse but that‚Äôs if there is space since larger groups typically take that space.

During the week they do allow laptop use (on weekends and statutory holidays laptops aren‚Äôt allowed) but they only allow you to connect to their wifi for 1hr. After an hour the wifi craps out and you won‚Äôt be able to renew your wifi time, at least that was my experience for both my laptop and mobile device.

If you‚Äôre looking for a space to work on your laptop for over an hour while having coffee/light bites during the week, this is not the place for you."

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Lucy Nguyen,3 months ago, 4 stars ,"RECOMMENDATION - Overall, if you want light snacks that don't overwhelm you and a place to chill, this will be right in your alley.

Food  - I got the Egg Salad Sando, Black Tea, and Basque Cheese Cake. Out of the three, the one I enjoyed the most was the Cheesecake. The other two fell flat for me. It was just standard, light snacks. Not memorable, but not bad.

Service - Great! Quick, professional and friendly. They were swamped and were working non-spot. You have lovely people working there.

Ambiance - Lots of seating to gather to talk to friends. I saw a bunch of people able to chill and chat. I love the atmosphere, and it boosted the place for me.

Accessibility: Getting in was a bit dicey, and the seating was very cramped. However, everything was on the first floor.

EDIT - Added an extra star for their reply and willingness to change. Most companies don't do that! :)"

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Tanya Rabushka,4 months ago, 5 stars ,"I adore this coffee place. Best coffee downtown. I come for coffee every weekend and noticed recent changes. The barista has changed; coffee is still best, but the serving upsets. Sometimes I get less coffee in a cup, no heart drawings on the top (so fewer customers want to take a picture and post it, so less advertising for Neo), and already twice got colder coffee than it should be. I love this place; I just hope that some work will be done with the new barista and the previous level of coffee serving will be back."
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Lina Wu,4 months ago, 1 star ,Coffee isn't bad but I ordered on their own website and they didn't even realize they had orders until I mentioned it. They also only allow you to use their wifi for 1 hour. After the hour is up you have to wait 2 hours before you can retry. Disappointing because a lot of people like to do work at cafes...

Everything was fine when I ordered: ordered 2 iced matcha latte and one mochi to go. I didn‚Äôt know I need to get the lids myself so when the lady barista gave me the drinks without lids I just reminded her that‚Äôs for take away, and she looked very grumpy and rude just pointed and told me it‚Äôs over there. Speaking with the latte, I think the one I had at the festival was better, I think there‚Äôs not enough sugar and matcha taste can be stronger"

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Victor,5 months ago, 3 stars ,"Japanese inspired decor and cakes, but missing the Japanese inspired service.

We ordered some of their vegan cookies and coffee.  The service was surprisingly slow, especially for just drip coffee.  Our coffees arrived sticky and covered in syrup/honey.  The barista was also annoyed when we asked for another cup to cover the residue.

Great place to sit down for a cake or to chill out, but the service is a bit lacking."

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Steph Lauz,5 months ago, 1 star ,"I saw this place online and saw they had pretty good reviews. However, when I went with my friend today I was really disappointed‚Ä¶ the prices are high for what you get, I assumed that since it‚Äôs more expensive then most places it would be better, I was VERY wrong. We watched the girl make our drinks and it‚Äôs straight up milk with a splash of matcha and hojicha. We ordered three items total and it came up to $30‚Ä¶ and the matcha tiramisu was not so good either and is served in a small dirty jar. Again you would think for that price it would be great, yeah save your money and go to Starbucks instead. I‚Äôm really sad and disappointed cause even the service wasn‚Äôt that great, the atmosphere is horrible if you plan on bringing a laptop cause there‚Äôs only two large tables available, the rest of the tables are the same size as a chair."

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Alexis Jieun Bae,6 months ago, 2 stars ,This was my first visit to place and my experience wasn't really great; I probably had too high expectation based on higher rating and good reviews. The place was pretty busy with limited/uncomfortable seats and only 1hr free access to wifi. And most of the drinks and food menu were quite pricey for the size and quality of the products. Overrated.
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Jennifer He,6 months ago, 2 stars ,"The barista called  me out when I was half way through my drink saying my card didn‚Äôt go through (although my Apple wallet showed a transaction and I showed it to her) and I ended up paying twice.

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,I Chen (AngelsofGod),6 months ago, 5 stars ,"I haven't been to the NEO coffee bar for quite sometime and wanted to see if it had changed. I purchase a hojicha matcha iced latte and half a strawberry rolled cake. The drink is something amazing as it had a host of bitter, sweet and the cool ice melding into a drink. The strawberry roll was delicious which had plenty of strawberries, freshly whipped cream clustered in the centre of the sponge roll. I would like to try their other drinks like the genmicha as it sounds interesting."
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Steph Parsons,6 months ago, 3 stars ,"Lovely caf√© but disappointing, rather weak coffee (unless they were just having a bad day when I dropped in). However, the Sandos were excellent, flavoursome and substantial (highly recommend the egg salad and the smoked salmon)."
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Shurraj Rao,6 months ago, 4 stars ,"Their pastries and sandwiches are pretty nice. Peach Roll Cake was light, not too peachy, but fluffy indeed. Egg Sando was nice except for the fact that the contents will slob if taken out of their packaging (which they don't bother cutting in the middle).

Place is nice but can get loud when patrons speak loudly. No noise absorption, sound just bounces everywhere. Will still come back though but maybe sit outside."

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Bilal Akil,7 months ago, 5 stars ,"Best coffee shop in Toronto.
Impeccable quality. Very special selection of coffee variety."
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,T.,7 months ago, 2 stars ,"Picked up an Americano and almond croissant here on my way to work. First impression is that the space is really pretty with modern Japanese cafe vibes. I went in wanting a croissant and when I first saw it in the display, I ignored my first thoughts that it looked kind of deflated and very small, especially for almost $5.

The coffee was pretty good. A pretty standard Americano and there's a station for your milk and sugar by the door.

The almond croissant might be the worst I've ever had. First up, it's a narrow shape and small, not wider than even a standard credit card (see pic for reference). Second, the texture was like a dense tortilla because there were no layers inside which I suspect is because the dough wasn't proofed and collapsed while baking (see pics for reference).  Third, the flavour was so off. It had no almond extract aroma or much flavour at all. Instead, because the croissant sits beside the rosemary cheddar croissant in the display, my croissant took on all the essence of sharp cheddar and rosemary and it was so off putting.

I've heard good things about their cakes but I don't recommend their croissants at all."

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Kimchi Kim,8 months ago, 1 star ,"I thought coffee shops are for people to grab a coffee, settle down and do work... until I found Neo Coffee Bar, which tries to get rid of their customers as quickly as possible from limiting wifi usage to 1 hr per day to enforcing a 'no-laptop' policy during peak hours. If you despise customers sticking around why open a coffee shop of all things?"

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Cacey L,8 months ago, 4 stars ,"(Translated by Google) Hojicha Tea/Latte is delicious. It is recommended to go ice-free without sugar. The environment is more beautiful than Bloom Cafe, with more locations and an outdoor patio, but the cake puffs are worse than Bloom. Very noisy, not suitable for office and reading.

The Sakura and Matcha lattes were quite nice, but I felt like the matcha flavour was lacking, slightly on the weaker side.

Overall for my first time there I did enjoy everything"
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Purvi Rathod,10 months ago, 5 stars ,"I love Neo coffee bar! The first time I went there, I had a matcha that was recommended by a colleague.

It‚Äôs a shame because they used to be a great place for regular coffee with premium beans.

I used to drive half way across town to get here.  No point anymore."

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Zhu Stephanie,10 months ago, 5 stars ,"(Translated by Google) This coffee shop located on Bay St in downtown Toronto is actually a branch. I remember going to the old shop in the early years. It is near George Brown College, and the old shop is relatively small.
This branch has a lot of atmosphere. As soon as you enter the store, you can feel the atmosphere of Japanese simplicity. Vertical grain wood strips are used as wall decoration, which is beautiful, chic and tasteful. There are enough guests, and the characteristic wooden table with log design is very large, and the whole feeling is very comfortable.
The cashier area is big enough, and the clerk is busy making coffee.
The eye-catching ones are colorful Japanese cake desserts. The roll cake selection is mouth-watering, and I immediately ordered a piece of [Maple Walnut Roll Cake] and added a cup of latte. Sit down and enjoy!
The cake looks good, the cream is not too sweet, and the taste is okay. The latte is smooth!
‚ùáÔ∏èIn general, I feel that both the environment and the production are pretty good. Many people take out desserts, next time you can try puffs and other Western-style buns. Good looks are pleasing to the eye!

I see not everybody agrees with the no-devices policy at certain times and the limited wifi, but I see it as a great and necessary way to keep customers moving and not taking up a seat for hours after buying one coffee. Even with those policies, it can be hard to find a seat with all the people using their laptops."
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Asma S.,10 months ago, 3 stars ,"I first got introduced to NEO at their Frederick St location, which was great. However, the location on bay is completely OVERTAKEN by students (who are there just for how pretty the place is) to the point where one can‚Äôt drink their coffee in peace or even study/work. Service depends on who you‚Äôre being served by but overall it‚Äôs decent. The food and drinks are good and I love how they differentiate themselves from other coffee shops.

The place is very stylish and cozy, great atmosphere. I like the fact there's lots of light thanks to the bay windows. I do prefer this location compared to the other one on Fredrick str for this reason.
I just wish the tables of the seats around the wall where larger.

Also, they do have a changing table in the washroom, which makes a big difference if you're a parent and come with your baby üöº

I just think it‚Äôs not sweet enough so you would have to add more sweetener than provided, if you like sweet tasting coffee. Overall, I would recommend and definitely try out more flavours."

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Î∞îÎûåÍ≥ºÌï®ÍªòÏÇ¥Îπ†ÏßÄÎã§,11 months ago, 2 stars ,"(Translated by Google) The atmosphere and location are great, but it's too inconvenient to work for a long time. The desk is small and Wi-Fi is limited to 1 hour... I don't know if the taste is so special for the price.

The atmosphere of the store and location are good, however it is so uncomfortable to stay long or do something in the cafe. Desks are too small and it is always crowded. Wifi is only 1 hour limit. I cannot feel the specialty of the flavors compared to the expensive price.

The coffee is wonderful and flavourful and they have a wide variety of coffee and tea based drink for those who want something else. The desserts are lovely and cute as well, I'd recommend their Lemon tarts or their Cookie choux. This is a pricy place so Id say maybe don't go everyday, it will break your bank. The tables are insanely small (with the exception of one large table) so don't even think about going their to do work or study. it gets quite busy, so you'll have to be lucky when looking for a table too. If you can grab a seat, the environment is great and it's the perfect place to chat with a new friend or catch up with an old one."

Their baristas were used to be polite and nice, but now they've changed. I asked for an iced americano and the barista didn't hear it right so they made a wrong coffee (an iced latte). I was okay with that and asked to make it again for me. But they never apologized or asked for a refund unless I told them to. I know it is just a few dollars but this is not right.. You should've gone ahead and asked your customer first that you charged more because you got wrong orders.
I got a refund and paid a right amount again, but the fact that I had to raise this up by myself without hearing any apologies from them is very disappointing.

I went this place a week later again to grab a coffee but the lady who worked there was not polite and nice at all. She was just staring at me when I stood in front of the cashier to order. What an awkward moment! She didn't asked me what to orser so I just told her my drinks and food. She didn't say a word...I don't feel welcomed in this place anymore and feel ignored. I understand that people have bad days, busy days or whatsoever but you should not bring your mood to your workplace and express that feelings to your customers. That's very unprofessional. I might not go back to this place for a while and instead will go to Jimmy's because their staffs are great and very professional."

Unfortunately NEO uses plastic shards on top of this cake labeling them. That got smooshed into the cake and got lodged in my throat. Really not a pleasant experience. Plastic labels should not go onto a pastry that is made to eat. I am still giving NEO a 4 star because I believe their things are tasty. But the Tiramisu was poorly executed. I hope you stop using plastic labels on top of food! You could really hurt someone with these practices.

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Kathleene Sim,a year ago, 5 stars ,"This location is near my workplace, so I make weekly visits. What really stands out to me at this location above every other cafe in the area is the service. Every visit is met with a warm, friendly welcome. The baristas give their undivided attention to each person who comes to the store, even if they are busy! It also doesn't take long for them to prep orders. They seem to be welcome to trying out customizations (provided that you aren't expecting extra ingredients for free of course). They sell coffee and a variety of Japanese teas, as they are a Japanese caf√©, by the cup and by the package. I personally enjoy the Kabusecha, and Iced Matcha/Hojicha Lattes with their Housemade Vanilla Syrup. They sell a few Japanese-inspired pastries, like croissants, cookies, muffins, with Japanese flavours like matcha, yuzu, etc. While they are good, none of them stand out to me. In terms of more filling food, they do sell sandwiches. Having tried their selection several times, I can confirm that I do not really like them as I find them to be too salty."

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Krista K,2 years ago, 4 stars ,"I love Neo!

Tried a lot of pastries and coffee/tea lattes from this place over the past year thanks to covid.

Recommend:
1. Hojicha tea latte. A lot of reviewers mention matcha but hojicha is wayy better than matcha. Their hojicha is pretty solid and authentic.
2. Espresso. Their beans are delicious and baristas know how to pull a perfect shot.
3. Cookies
Matcha cookies and dark chocolate sea salt! If you don't like overly sweet cookies, you will love cookies from Neo!

Not sure:
Roll cakes- so inconsistent when it comes to quality???? Sometimes they are amazing sometimes they are soggy and gross. Hope they can do betty quality control?
Choux: dry and tasteless. Sorry ü•≤... I wanted to love them."

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Chloe T.,2 years ago, 3 stars ,"Pricey, IG-able Japanese style coffee shop.
INSIDE: Very few empty sits, tables are quite small (for 2 cups of coffee, or 1 laptop), not for big group.

MENU: very cute roll cakes, croissants & other pastries. Roll cakes are not that good, a bit DRY. But the Tiramisu is very creamy and refreshing.
*** They have new special menu every month.

DRINKS: the Matcha Latte I ordered is a bit plain, couldn't taste the matcha flavor in it. Not bad but nothing special.

OVERALL: good place to sit down & chat with ONE friend (not a group), but pastry & drinks are not special & a bit pricey.

* Fun fact: the place's belong to the same Kinka, Kinton Family"

2020.09.20. Tge last stop today was to order, pickup, and deliver to the famillia a Hot Americano and an Iced Americano. Nice place. Good Coffee. They add water to the Americano to you satisfaction. A variety of desserts (cookies, muffins, croissants) and sandwiches on display. The location is very convenient for us 2min walk."

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Prashanth S,2 years ago, 5 stars ,"A great location and vibe for a nice coffee shop and mini desserts! It is really a great place to study or even go on a first date. It is a very earth tone vibe restaurant that has mini round single person study table. This location is quite popular and may get crowded but if you go early enough you will definitely get some peaceful time to yourself or a nice date with your significant other. I will always recommend this place and definitely visit again.

The only downside I can think of is that the prices are on the expensive side compared to other cafes. If they lower the price of their food items, it‚Äôs definitely a place to beat in downtown Toronto."
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,DANIEL WEI,2 years ago, 5 stars ,"Stopping by this marvellous cafe was the best choice I made today. The coffees made by the barista, Christopher was fantastic.

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Phoenix Kiula,2 years ago, 2 stars ,"The original Neo in downtown remains one of the best shops in Toronto but somehow the flavours are not replicated here in Bay st area. The coffee technique is great but the beans this store has chosen tend to disappoint: a mild musty flavour. The foods as always are ludicrously overpriced..a tiny sliver of a salmon and tomato sandwich for 8.95 which in reality with taxes and tips is 12 bucks. I can get the entire loaf of bread, a bunch of tomatoes, and pickles and sauce for less than that price :) Some practical pricing wouldn‚Äôt hurt get more people consuming these things. Anyway good to have options in the hood but it‚Äôll be nice to have better coffee beans."

This cafe is located super close to downtown core, and they have a nice seating area for everyone for find a cute little table for themselves and study.

I also love their amazing pastries selection and handcrafted dessert cake rolls as well~ especially their monthly specials! I didn't get to try the cakes but ingot the spinach and feta pastry which was super super delicious! They warmed it up by request so I definitely recommend to warm it up for a crisp texture

Kyoto Matcha Latte - $5.95
Spinach and Feta Pie"
NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Matcha Snob,2 years ago, 4 stars ,"Cute Japanese coffee shop! Love the clean and minimal aesthetic. Beautiful cafe for IG photos esp. since they have pretty big windows so the lighting is pretty good. Compared to their other location, this one seems much busier and there aren't as many seats so would recommend going during off hours to avoid the crowd or be prepared to wait a bit for a spot. I've tried quite a few of their pastries and cakes and don't think there have been any that I disliked but their monthly specials are much more memorable than their daily pastries and cakes. Neo is on the pricier side, but I think it's worth it given the quality and atmosphere.

On my most recent trip, I got their March special, the matcha yuzu tiramisu. It was absolutely delicious!  The yuzu takes center stage for this dessert; the matcha is more subtle and adds a nice earthiness to complement the tart flavour from the yuzu and sweetness from the cream. Love how the yuzu cuts the heaviness of the cream and adds such a refreshing flavour! Perfect dessert to celebrate the warm Spring weather! My only complaint is the size... I wish it was triple the size! Could eat at least three cups of these!  So yummy! ‚Å£

Highly recommend Neo!"

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Julia Hovanskaya,3 years ago, 1 star ,"The WORST coffee/ tea experience.
The coffee has burnt taste, which is ususally noticeable with the cheap coffee variations.
The Matcha Tea is only sweetened, very small and overpriced (over 6$).
The stuff is not cooperative. When asked to change the order, every small tweak has to be paid for.
The weekends reserved for non-laptop time, so it is impossible to study... and even during other days, the tables are a size of a pea.

NEVER recommend"

NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Harmony Granger,3 years ago, 2 stars ,"The staff are very polite, but maybe because this is a new location and staff are quite inexperienced, they are missing attention to detail that was in the Frederick shop. I had two rewards cards with 11 stamps, and asked for them to be combined and used for a drip coffee. They didn't give me the extra stamp back, but that's okay. I paid for two muffins, but only received one and had to ask for the second one. The other staff member said I only got one without even checking the receipt; I asked them to check their receipt, and then they apologized and gave me my second muffin. I got my order to go and was not offered a copy of my receipt to confirm, but either they increased their prices by a lot (just shy of $17 for a local brew pourover and two blueberry muffins?), or they accidentally charged for the free drip coffee anyway :( Overall, the collection of errors within one visit made me feel like the staff and managers were not really ready; a smooth customer experience for a weekday morning takeout is essential for a mid-priced coffee and pastry shop to nail down. I hope the quality of service will be more like the original location once the staff get more experience!"

Coffee Island,Bay St,Negar Shahrokh,8 months ago, 5 stars ,"I‚Äôm obsessed with this place! They have a cool interior design, professional and friendly baristas, and the best filled croissants! So far, I‚Äôve tried their Turkish coffee (they call it Greek coffee in the menu), banana walnut croissant, and pistachio croissant. My favorite is the banana walnuts so far but I‚Äôm going back to try other ones as well. The only issue is that their roasted beans are slightly overpriced but I like that they sell them in sealed reusable bags."
Coffee Island,Bay St,Kevin,8 months ago, 5 stars ,"Friendly and attentive staff, a wide variety of coffee, and the option to buy niche and interesting coffee brewing devices. The selection of coffee, along with the variety of brewing techniques, make this a must visit cafe on it's own, but the baristas truly made the experience for me. After a small problem with one of the machines, the barista remade my coffee 3 times until it was up to par, and went out of his way to ensure he made me the best cup of coffee possible."

Most likely pet friendly. Very often you'll see dogs just outside, and on the odd day you'll spot a small cat in a trolley"
Coffee Island,Bay St,Alin S.,8 months ago, 5 stars ,Best croissant ever!
Coffee Island,Bay St,Quarrington Z,8 months ago, 3 stars ,"Unfortunately, this cup of single origin americano was over-extracted. Grinds are too fine and there are coffee bean sediments at the bottom of the cup. Also, over-extraction caused the coffee way too sour and astringent, undrinkable . For a $4.5 americano, I hoped it is at least decently crafted. However, I consider this to be an isolated event and would try again next time."

Coffee Island,Bay St,Sara Ameri,11 months ago, 1 star ,Can't say how the coffee is since I never got to order anything despite waiting in line for 10 mins. The barista was chatting up with a customer while very slowly preparing the order. The other baristas were just idly looking around and at me waiting in line but none of them seemed willing to take an order. I was in a hurry so I just left and got my mid-day coffee somewhere else. Not bothering with this place again.

I asked for dark roast and since the dark roast coffee container was almost empty, she just topped up my cup from the medium roast container. If that wasn't enough, the blueberry scone I ordered was rubbery and not really fresh. It's a shame because I really liked their coffee on my first visit."

One note - when ordering, be prepared that they have a lot of cup sizes to offer. 12 Oz is closer to your expected regular size in any other high quality coffee chain. I keep making mistake with ordering 8 Oz :)

This coffee place also has a lot of very tasty pastries. You should check it out!

Their prices are more than Tim's or Starbucks but again, I don't care as I prefer to support small businesses and would rather support the local community.

Oh, and their chocolate almond croissant- the best I've had in Toronto"
Coffee Island,Bay St,Vineed,2 years ago, 5 stars ,"This is a cute little place on the Bay and Wellesley corridor and they have really nice staff! We were on a fall walk and didn't carry any credit cards on us. We had recently activated google pay (so, we weren't sure if it would work or not).

We told the lady at the counter to try charging us first to make sure it went through - and she was like ""that's fine, you guys obviously live in the area - you can drop by and pay later if it does not work""

Our payment worked :)

Very genuine and friendly customer service - that's really difficult to find these days. Kudos to their staff!

The coffee was great. They also have flavored hot chocolate (my wife tried the strawberry one - it tasted like the red quality street chocolate, for the one's who know it!)

Great place. Do check out if you are in the neighborhood."

Coffee Island,Bay St,Dana Young,2 years ago, 3 stars ,"Use to really like this coffee shop but service has been lacking. This kid made a latte when my friend ordered a cappuccino. Asked before grabbing the drink if this was a latte because the foam was very thin. The barista replied ‚Äú oh it‚Äôs the same thing ‚Äú ... DID NOT even bothered to offer to make a new one , just went back doing his own thing.... that kinda ruined my liking of this place sorry.

Just shows he doesn‚Äôt even know the difference between a cappuccino and latte.

Anyways, always crowded. It‚Äôs great that they have outdoor seating, and it‚Äôs dog friendly but unfortunately the way the building is built creates a massive wind tunnel. So it‚Äôs always very windy when sitting outdoor during the summer."

Coffee Island,Bay St,Sarah Yahya,3 years ago, 1 star ,"I‚Äôm not sure why this place is rated this well given how terrible my experience was. I came in looking to have an iced mocha - a very typical drink available in most cafes; but I suppose not here.

As I was asking if it was available and told no by the person at the counter, i said can I order hot mocha with ice. He said sure; but then out of nowhere the owner (or manager?) maybe in the most patronizing tone told me that it‚Äôs very important to know your drink and that the only way to make an iced mocha is by making it an ice blended drink. She continued on saying that ""you need to trust us on this; how else would you make an iced mocha if not to blend it with ice "". I held off my thought since I really didn‚Äôt  want to make any scene there; but FYI ma‚Äôam; people have been making iced mochas since forever. In my mind also, what kind of a cafe would this be with this kind of manager/owner. Even another customer next to me said in front of an employee that she‚Äôs had lots of iced mochas in other cafes.

So I went on to order and iced latte and was asked if I wanted to add a chocolate shot in it; and I said why not. But I got the drink and realized wow - I now kind of understand why; this was possibly the worst ""iced latte"" I‚Äôve ever had in my life. I‚Äôve been drinking coffee since I was 6 so I know a thing or two about the drinks; and that was by no means an iced latte. I think McDonald‚Äôs iced coffee might have been a better choice.

The only salvation for this place was the nice little patio it has with good internet; but that‚Äôs about it I‚Äôd say. I‚Äôd not be coming back - that‚Äôs for sure"

Got the Single Greek coffee and it tasted fine. Then again I'm not that into coffee so that's probably why. The fruit tart was pretty good but pricey ( think it was $4-$5 but I don't remember). Reasonably priced due to the location of the shop so I didn't expect much.

Personally I don't see myself as a regular customer here but if you work/live around the area and your fine with their prices, it's a nice place to go."

Coffee Island,Bay St,James Murray,5 years ago, 5 stars ,The specialty coffee here is incredible. Some of the smoothest tasting espresso I've ever had. As another reviewer has noted the place is a bit cramped and the counter is confusing. Arguably these are just growing pains for this brand new shop and the quality of the product vastly outweighs the minor inconvenience. The staff are very friendly and really know their coffee. Definitely isn't the place to go if you're looking for speedy service but it is the place to go if you're looking for a product made with love.
Coffee Island,Bay St,Dana Skalin,5 years ago, 3 stars ,"For the negatives: It is cramped and confused. The to-go self service station is tiny, we are talking 1 square foot, so only one person can use at a time to make their coffee. The food is expensive and not great. I had the breakfast sandwhich with bacon and egg and cheese and it was ok, like I said, not great.

For the positives: It has a cool vibe, lots of good coffee and you can buy whole bean and grind it in the store. The people working the counter are knowledgeable and friendly.

Overall this is a good coffee-only place if you have some time. If you need food or are in rush, go elsewhere."

A little sad that they only have 3 functional tables so if you are planning to go there to work, don‚Äôt. Or at-least have a backup plan. Tea was good but not worth five dollars. Pastries however, were phenomenal and I thoroughly enjoyed their raspberry croissant.

The atmospheres is really cute and service was quick and kind so I may try to come early to get a table and study for the day, but not to sure if it‚Äôs worth it."
White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Healani Norman,3 months ago, 4 stars ,"Very minimalistic coffee shop, I love it!!! The menu is easily compartmentalized so you're not spending twenty minutes deciding or even trying to locate what you want.

We sat outside at one of the tables out front and people watched for a little while. Very lovely overall :)"
White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,A Dreamer (ASA),3 months ago, 4 stars ,"I don‚Äôt usually go to small cafes like this (I go to big mainstream ones) but coming to this one on a whim at 8AM on a rainy morning was very cathartic. I‚Äôm not in Toronto all the time, so in a dry corner outside I spent 10 mins trying to find a cafe open, as it was 7:30am and many came up and frankly I walked the distance to a few, to which I couldn‚Äôt find and or cafes that didn‚Äôt feel right. When I saw this one I was pulled in b/c the name and honestly I‚Äôm glad I made the walking trip in the cold that morning. I had a version of a green tea White Rabbit Caffe offered & it was very bitter but that‚Äôs green tea for you üòÇ it was a big cup, I spent an hour or so here with my air buds in and I was not bothered.

White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Kathleene Sim,6 months ago, 5 stars ,"I've been searching for a cafe that opens early in the morning ~7AM on weekdays so I can spend some time having breakfast before I head over to work. I'd always known this caf√© existed but I never took the leap to visit until today, and I'm really glad I took that chance.

The exterior is tiny and unassuming, but when you come in, you're invited into a small, cozy space filled with greenery in the form of decor, and lots of seating. It's a very home-y atmosphere and has this unpolished vibe to it ‚Äì I liked it; it reminded me of a cafe I used to visit while in school.

I ordered a lavender latte and pistachio croissant. The barista was kind and helpful with describing the lavender latte, as I had some concerns. They were also able to sub in oat milk, as I'm a bit lactose intolerant.

I love lavender in theory, but any strong aromas of it truthfully turns me away. The latte I got was like the idea of lavender; the flavour was definitely there, but in a really subtle way, which is how I'd hoped it to be. The pistachio croissant was GREAT. They really didn't skimp on that filling.

I'll be back soon to try the rest of the menu!"

White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Adel B,7 months ago, 1 star ,"Dissapointing experience. The drinks are very watered down, and the lids don't even fit properly so it spills when you try to drink which stained my pants.

I have been to other caf√©s with to-go iced drink cups that look like plastic but are indeed compostable, but this one has a recyclable symbol.

White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Adam Schneider,a year ago, 5 stars ,"I‚Äôd give this place 10 stars if I could. For one thing, the espresso was great, and every americano or latte or flat white I got was perfect. For another, the owner (who was most often the person behind the counter when we went in) was a breath of fresh air - one of the few people in the city who was friendly, personable, and treated my wife and me as human beings. He‚Äôd always smile, chat, and he remembered our orders and things we told him. People often talk about ‚Äúlocal gems‚Äù and this place is the dictionary definition of that term. If I hadn‚Äôt left the city, I‚Äôd be there every day."

White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Timothy K,a year ago, 2 stars ,"The White Rabb was really missing ""it"" (see photo).

The most disappointing part of this coffee shop was that it has high reviews (4.7) at the time of writing this. In reality this is a 2-3 star coffee shop. The flat white was overly milky and technically a latte -I would say it fell flat. The google listing writes ""sandwiches and salads"" but middle of the day they only had like, 5-6 croissants to chose from and there was a fly on them. If you want to eat, go elsewhere.

Edit: Saw the owner's reply below, unfortunately the review wasn't written the same day as the experience took place so I doubt the ""barista in training"" excuse (also because I only saw one employee on site that day (Tuesday Oct 12th, app. 11:30am) and I'm fairly certain the barista that served us was the owner) and, I do appreciate the offer of a free coffee but we had come to the establishment for the sandwiches and salads, hopefully you guys will have that in the future."

White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Max Y,a year ago, 2 stars ,Been here for a couple of times. Lavender latte is so good and is also the main reason I go. Else I‚Äôll definitely choose other coffee shops because of the customer service of the male barista. Whenever I bump into the male barista his attitude somehow just makes you uncomfortable.

I like to order the cheese croissant when they're not sold out, a very tasty treat."

White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Andrew Gong,a year ago, 5 stars ,"I take a longer walk to this cafe because of the unique latte flavors that are not usually offered at other cafes, such as pistachio latte. I personally like their patio because though located on Bay Street, there‚Äôs not much foot/car traffic, especially as the sidewalk is wide on this portion of Bay Street. However, the patio is less ideal for patrons who prefer more shading from the sun as there isn‚Äôt much shading for most seats."

White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Bindu,a year ago, 1 star ,"Places that don't want to serve customers same quality of coffee during a promotion shouldn't participate in them. I was shopping around for a coffee shop that I could frequent, ordered an iced coffee from Ritual and got a watered down, weak drink. Went to Mos Mos just down the road that seems to know the point of promotions: to induce patronage. Which they did successfully.

White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,em ily,2 years ago, 1 star ,"The owner of this cafe can be very nice. I have been pre-COVID and he is very keen to engage every one of his customers. That being said, post-COVID I have been semi-terrified by his utter lack of respect for the guidelines. The last five times I have passed by or gone into the store to get something the man has his mask either not covering his nostrils or not covering his mouth at all! I have seen other reviewers mention this behavior and also seen the owner reply with an excuse like ""you came in when the cafe was empty"" but he definitely still does this when plenty of people are in the store. I definitely go less than I did before COVID because of this behaviour. There are plenty of other cafes that are rule-abiding and that have products that are just as good."

White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Sergei Makarov,3 years ago, 4 stars ,"Please either change your hours or don't close 15 minutes earlier. I went to your place at 19:45 today and the barista was already closing the cafe because ""there were no clients for the last hour"". Two other people arrived at the same time and also were turned away. Very frustrating experience.
Otherwise the place is great, pastries are especially good."

White Rabbit Caffe,Bay St,Rebecca Wilkinson,3 years ago, 5 stars ,Super cute little cafe on Bay street that serves up 10/10 espressos and great pastries (the pistachio croissants are especially amazing). They also serve a bunch of vegan or vegetarian options for lunch like veggie bowls and sandwiches. It's a nicely designed and cozy spot to sit down and hang out in if you are in the area.

Dispatch Coffee,Bay St,Dmitry Romanenko,a week ago, 5 stars ,"Comfy coffee spot inside of business center with tables. I was satisfied with quality of coffee and amount of available minimalistic seating area, but was a bit disappointed that when my coffee was meant to be brought by staff upstairs, but wasn't after 15 minutes, and when I found out that it's waiting at pickup area I had to bring it upstairs myself. I suggest they should either bring themselves or tell customers exactly that they should take care of it."

Dispatch Coffee,Bay St,Scott Norris,3 weeks ago, 5 stars ,My fav Montreal coffee finally made it to Toronto. Their beans are top notch with depth of flavour and profiles like few out there.

Dispatch Coffee,Bay St,FreeTayK47 l,3 weeks ago, 5 stars ,coffee is good. Security gaurd on weekend is so handsome and kind.
Dispatch Coffee,Bay St,J P,a month ago, 5 stars ,"My new favourite place to work and have amazing Montreal coffee!
It‚Äôs serendipitous because I remember walking into a dispatch during my first trip of Montreal last January and the barista told me a Toronto one would open in the near future.
Part of me wants this place to stay a little hidden so that it doesn‚Äôt become 120% occupied most of the time like most Toronto cafes.."

Everyone is super nice. It's a huge space nested in the financial district. Perfect spot to relax or do some work. The coffee is 11/10 and they rotate the beans everyday."

Dispatch Coffee,Bay St,Arianne Frias,a month ago, 4 stars ,"I always go to dispatch every after gym, but today, the barista wasnt that approachable, didnt even ask me if I want it hot or cold and just put what I said and asked me to pay then made my drink. So he made me the iced one, but I didnt told him that I want it hot. I know its my fault for forgetting, but I think its better to clarify things first as well before making a drink. Been to many coffee shops around downtown but I always go back to dispatch because of the great coffee, but I guess not anymore. Service is one of the most important aspects to attain customers. üòä"
Dispatch Coffee,Bay St,Joseph Munro,2 months ago, 5 stars ,"The best coffee I've ever had in Toronto. My latte had perfectly steamed milk, and the staff was very friendly."

It is a coffee shop where you can sit quietly and enjoy coffee in downtown Toronto.
There are about 8 tables on the 2nd floor, so you can sit and drink coffee. The customers are quiet, and there is quiet music in the cafe, so it seems to be a good space to come and read a book or study. The staff taking the order was also very kind, so I remember going there after drinking a pleasant coffee.

Dispatch Coffee,Bay St,Joshua Wiener,3 months ago, 4 stars ,
Dispatch Coffee,Bay St,M T,3 months ago, 4 stars ,"Went there to check out the coffee. Coffee shop is cute, seating is on second level with tables and couches. Has 11 types of ground available for purchase. I tried the Guatemala espresso ground today, on the bitter end with citrus/nectarine notes. Strong espresso. Has pastries and cookie treats. Cortado was $4.90 total. Good spot to check out downtown. Unsure if it would be my go to spot."
Dispatch Coffee,Bay St,Tara Kachroo,3 months ago, 4 stars ,"Corporate space - very clean and spacious, lots of natural light, very fast service, but regularly a line up in the morning right before 9am."

Dispatch Coffee,Bay St,Daniel Arsenault,4 months ago, 5 stars ,High quality coffee and a really quiet comfortable space to enjoy the coffee and some company.
Dispatch Coffee,Bay St,More Spinach,4 months ago, 1 star ,"No way is this a 4.7 in terms of actual coffee. Beautiful shop and great location. But coffee bean is now fruity mild Canadian rubbish, and baristas are often undertrained and overworked so they make a quick and dirty silly coffee I can make at home. Nor what this used to be. Still a decent rendezvous for meetings, but an ordinary coffee shop for actual coffee."
Dispatch Coffee,Bay St,Ally MYC,4 months ago, 5 stars ,Really good flat white. But what I loved the most was the upstairs seating area. Great ambience.

Dispatch Coffee,Bay St,Alan D,5 months ago, 5 stars ,"I recently had a latte here and I'm not sure if I've ever had a better latte before. It was absolutely delicious. Great minimalist look inside and I was also able to buy some home coffee gear I was running low on.

If there's any way for the latte to be warmer without compromising taste, please let me know because that would have allowed me to sip it slower and enjoy the drink for longer.

I'm looking forward to buying their beans to take home next time."
Dispatch Coffee,Bay St,Laura Ma,5 months ago, 5 stars ,"Excited to see a specialty coffee shop popping up in downtown core. Amazing specialty coffee, well crafted by their barista. I thoroughly enjoyed the decaf beans I tried. Would definitely go back and try other beans they serve."

Dispatch Coffee,Bay St,Sean Leung,5 months ago, 5 stars ,"Decided to visit since so close by to me. Did not regret it at all. Service was warm and pleasant. The barista Karen was so sweet and funny üòä.

I ordered a latte and - no joke - one of the best lattes I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure of sipping on. It was nutty, sweet - honey undertones, perfect amount of foam to milk to espresso‚Ä¶ and the art is nice too. I haven‚Äôt been buying much coffee from cafes but 100% worth it here and will come back

Edit (22/09/15):

Came back as promised. Tried the ‚Äúfor here‚Äù experience. After a few weeks of drinking my humble home brew coffee I had another one of the mind expanding lattes here‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt be beat and with taste well beyond its price point. I didn‚Äôt realize there was an upstairs lounge area with free wifi. It‚Äôs clean and neat, with outlets and great warm lighting. Studying at caf√©s was a pre-pandemic artifact for me but I‚Äôm enticed to have found a place where I can do this again üòÅ"
Dispatch Coffee,Bay St,Jun Park,5 months ago, 5 stars ,"This cafe is a gem in the heart of downtown! Clean, open, cozy, and a great space to chat or get some studying/work done. They have outlets at each table. Big glass windows and 2 clean washrooms downstairs. The barista Karen is super friendly too!! I will definitely be coming back in the future üòä"
Dispatch Coffee,Bay St,Farnoosh Brock,5 months ago, 5 stars ,"LOVE love Dispatch Coffee where we‚Äôve had their coffee, I‚Äôve tried their bottled juices (from a trusted source), and I‚Äôve spent a few hours upstairs in the wonderful area and had their Japanese tea as well. Perfect spot in the city for delicious high-end coffee and superbly nice staff!! THANK YOU for being there for us."

Dispatch Coffee,Bay St,Scott Cooper,8 months ago, 5 stars ,"Excellent Coffee, Great Service. I originally received a subscription to Dispatch, receiving two bags a month, from my daughter for my birthday.  Over the twelve months, I've had a non-stop flow of delicious beans, spanning a wide range of producing countries.  I have enjoyed it so much, that I've taken over the subscription myself.  Any problems I've had were taken care of quickly and professionally.  You can buy cheaper beans at the grocery store, but not nearly as flavourful as these have been."
Dispatch Coffee,Bay St,Ryan Cheung,8 months ago, 5 stars ,"Friendly baristas, great selection and high quality drinks - especially loved the Chai Latte!"
Dispatch Coffee,Bay St,SaraLi Forouzanfar,8 months ago, 4 stars ,"Great staff but everything is overpriced ($4 for a cookie???). Matcha latte has very little flavor, the hot chocolate is also flavorless and weird due to the frothed milk, only the chai tea latte is something I would drink (maybe a bit too much sugar/syrup added though). Don't drink coffee so I can't say anything about the many options they have. Nice space with upstairs seating, wall of glass windows, and washrooms."
Dispatch Coffee,Bay St,Marium Amin,9 months ago, 5 stars ,"Great coffee shop located nicely in the core of the city! I've tried the mocha and latte here, both are very delicious and well made."
Dispatch Coffee,Bay St,Elyjah Schimmens,10 months ago, 4 stars ,Great coffee and food for takeaway. Minimal seating for those looking to take a break from the office for a bit.

Solid coffee and great selection of home barista gear."
Dispatch Coffee,Bay St,Adrian B,10 months ago, 5 stars ,"Dropped by this morning for the first time in search of an Americano, will definitely be back.

Dispatch Coffee,Bay St,Benny Tong,a year ago, 4 stars ,"Too early to close, really hard for the people enjoy a cup of coffee after work, unless you are so close to the shop.  Hopefully, there is a change on the business hour in the future.

** Update : Very great to hear a DM from the coffee shop owner, and she mention that the store hour will be ramping up in spring season, I am feeling great that the coffee shop owner really care about every single comment from their customer ..... respect.  üëçüëçüëç **"

Dispatch Coffee,Bay St,G,a year ago, 1 star ,"It costs 3.50 for a their large size cup, which is a small or medium by my standards, and the flavor was like stale homemade Folgers that I drank in university that sat on the burner all day long.
Reply:  No, 12oz isn't generally considered large, not sure where you are getting your info from but Starbucks small is 12oz, mcdonalds small is 16oz, Second Cup small is 12oz."
Dispatch Coffee,Bay St,N'Gatta Aka,a year ago, 5 stars ,"I am a long time subscriber of their monthly delivery plan so I was quite excited to see them open a physical store in Toronto. Service was excellent and the coffee delicious, but that's no surprise. I salute their courage in committing to opening a store on Bay Street during these challenging but I sure hope it pays off in the long term."
Dispatch Coffee,Bay St,Erinna Sanders,a year ago, 5 stars ,Really good coffee. Super friendly staff!!
