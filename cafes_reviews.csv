198,Astrum Rimor,4 years ago, 5 stars ,"Very rude!, was a daily customer. Showed up christmas eve for my daily latte at 730 , no holiday hours posted. The young man working inside saw me standing there and we made eye contact 3 times over 15 minutes. Finally i knocked on the door to ask the hours and he came out and told me 8 oclock. You would think if you saw a customer standing out front that you would take 30 seconds out of your day to let them know when they can come in.

i will not return",Bud's Coffee

Cafe au lait not so much. They used brewed coffee (would have preferred a shot of espresso or a stronger brewed coffee) with steamed milk and charged the same price as a latte - what a disappointment.",Bud's Coffee

239,John Orzel,4 years ago, 5 stars ,"I feel like the Beaches are purposely keeping Bud's under wraps and not letting anyone know about this spot. I had no idea about Bud's and was dreading of finding a good cup in a new spot. With the overwhelming positives for this spot, I stepped into their door and was happy to Sam James beans being used.

Recently, it sounds like they moved to a bigger spot and still making a great cup. It is still very busy... even on a lazy Saturday afternoon, there was no tables freed up and the constant line up was in and out of the place. It has a great friendly vibe and everyone here is quite warm with each other. It's clear that Bud's has made themselves part of the community because of the number of personal conversations between patrons or the staff and patrons. This was really nice to see. I guess Toronto can be friendly after all!

I have to appreciate how they use the good Canadian brands like Pluck and Cut Coffee to create their drinks. Nothing like supporting a good local. I think the baristas really know their drinks cause the flat whites we got were surpassing some of the well known coffee shops that sit on Toronto top 50.

Flat White with almond milk - The butter knife beans are just so good and Bud's did them right. This was a rich and robust coffee flavour with a touch of milkiness from the microfoamed milk. No acidity to make me wince. We decided to do the cashew and almond milk side by side taste test. I personally liked the almond milk more. I found it didn't influence the flat white as much and let the coffee flavour be more forward. I liked this one. 4/5

Flat White with cashew milk - I found the cashew milk version to have less of a coffee flavour... it definitely changed the taste. I would say it was a milkier flavour but more muted for sure. I did find cashew milk to be creamier than the almond milk but also weirdly enough, I touch more sweet? So if you're looking for the texture the most closest to cow's milk, this would probably be your favourite alternative milk. Kudos to Buds for offering more than one type of nut milk. 4/5

If I'm far out east again, I'll definitely make Bud my choice to get a good flat white and happy I'm not stuck to Starbucks.",Bud's Coffee

1005,Roger Velazquez,3 weeks ago, 4 stars ,"(Translated by Google) A place where you can buy coffee, more marketing than product, more packaging than good ingredients. I asked for a coffee in the Chemex preparation method, and the Colombian coffee lacked acidity, aroma, body, well below the acceptable quality level. The sign outside the coffee shop says Roasters, but they don't roast there, just an over-marketed coffee shop. Accessible prices. They have Wi-Fi.

They won't do anything to help with WiFi because they say their system relies on that WiFi and doing anything is risky.

This coffee place also has a lot of very tasty pastries. You should check it out!

We told the lady at the counter to try charging us first to make sure it went through - and she was like ""that's fine, you guys obviously live in the area - you can drop by and pay later if it does not work""

Our payment worked :)

Very genuine and friendly customer service - that's really difficult to find these days. Kudos to their staff!

The coffee was great. They also have flavored hot chocolate (my wife tried the strawberry one - it tasted like the red quality street chocolate, for the one's who know it!)

DID NOT even bothered to offer to make a new one , just went back doing his own thing.... that kinda ruined my liking of this place sorry.

Just shows he doesn‚Äôt even know the difference between a cappuccino and latte.

1365,Freya,4 years ago, 4 stars ,"I‚Äôm not sure why this place is rated this well given how terrible my experience was. I came in looking to have an iced mocha - a very typical drink available in most cafes; but I suppose not here.

As I was asking if it was available and told no by the person at the counter, i said can I order hot mocha with ice. He said sure; but then out of nowhere the owner (or manager?) maybe in the most patronizing tone told me that it‚Äôs very important to know your drink and that the only way to make an iced mocha is by making it an ice blended drink. She continued on saying that ""you need to trust us on this; how else would you make an iced mocha if not to blend it with ice "". I held off my thought since I really didn‚Äôt  want to make any scene there; but FYI ma‚Äôam; people have been making iced mochas since forever. In my mind also, what kind of a cafe would this be with this kind of manager/owner. Even another customer next to me said in front of an employee that she‚Äôs had lots of iced mochas in other cafes.

So I went on to order and iced latte and was asked if I wanted to add a chocolate shot in it; and I said why not. But I got the drink and realized wow - I now kind of understand why; this was possibly the worst ""iced latte"" I‚Äôve ever had in my life. I‚Äôve been drinking coffee since I was 6 so I know a thing or two about the drinks; and that was by no means an iced latte. I think McDonald‚Äôs iced coffee might have been a better choice.

The only salvation for this place was the nice little patio it has with good internet; but that‚Äôs about it I‚Äôd say. I‚Äôd not be coming back - that‚Äôs for sure",Coffee Island

There menu has a lot of amazing pastries, desserts and things to nibble on and complement my espresso. What I appreciate the most is the consistency in quality. Lots of coffee shops spin up and the quality winds down over time. Dineen raises the bar every time. This location has wifi and seats for those who want to work or even order some afternoon drinks (yes liquor is served here), I am more of a coffee guy though.",Dineen Coffee Co

The chocolate croissant was nothing special. I recommend passing on the baked goods as this is the third item I have tried at Dineen that tasted like packaged baked goods. Not bad by any means but not worth the price.

Disappointed but cognizant that it is the Financial district so items everywhere are always a little marked up.

Ambiance is lovely and the decor is definitely nice! Good place for meeting a client or friend!",Dineen Coffee Co

3002,Dmitry Romanenko,a week ago, 5 stars ,"Comfy coffee spot inside of business center with tables. I was satisfied with quality of coffee and amount of available minimalistic seating area, but was a bit disappointed that when my coffee was meant to be brought by staff upstairs, but wasn't after 15 minutes, and when I found out that it's waiting at pickup area I had to bring it upstairs myself. I suggest they should either bring themselves or tell customers exactly that they should take care of it.",Dispatch Coffee

It‚Äôs serendipitous because I remember walking into a dispatch during my first trip of Montreal last January and the barista told me a Toronto one would open in the near future.
Part of me wants this place to stay a little hidden so that it doesn‚Äôt become 120% occupied most of the time like most Toronto cafes..",Dispatch Coffee

So he made me the iced one, but I didnt told him that I want it hot. I know its my fault for forgetting, but I think its better to clarify things first as well before making a drink. Been to many coffee shops around downtown but I always go back to dispatch because of the great coffee, but I guess not anymore. Service is one of the most important aspects to attain customers. üòä",Dispatch Coffee

It is a coffee shop where you can sit quietly and enjoy coffee in downtown Toronto.
There are about 8 tables on the 2nd floor, so you can sit and drink coffee. The customers are quiet, and there is quiet music in the cafe, so it seems to be a good space to come and read a book or study. The staff taking the order was also very kind, so I remember going there after drinking a pleasant coffee.

I tried the Guatemala espresso ground today, on the bitter end with citrus/nectarine notes. Strong espresso. Has pastries and cookie treats. Cortado was $4.90 total. Good spot to check out downtown.

3061,Benny Tong,a year ago, 4 stars ,"No way is this a 4.7 in terms of actual coffee. Beautiful shop and great location. But coffee bean is now fruity mild Canadian rubbish, and baristas are often undertrained and overworked so they make a quick and dirty silly coffee I can make at home. Nor what this used to be. Still a decent rendezvous for meetings, but an ordinary coffee shop for actual coffee.",Dispatch Coffee
3062,Alexandra Marquez,a year ago, 5 stars ,"Hi there More Spinach - we're disappointed to hear you didn't enjoy your visit at our Toronto location. We'd like to hear more about the coffee you were served. You can reach us at info@dispatchcoffee.ca.

We are a third wave coffee roaster, thus our beans are roasted medium-light and are very different from say traditional Italian espresso caf√©s! We encourage you to read more about the coffee farmers we support here: www.dispatchcoffee.ca/pages/impact. Our baristas are well trained and experienced in the industry, but we understand if you didn't like the drink you ordered! Hoping to hear from you via email.",Dispatch Coffee

4003,Courtney Ayukawa,4 weeks ago, 3 stars ,"Vibe and atmosphere is cute and cozy with a good amount of seating upstairs.

I think they recently increased their prices and the menu on their website might be out of date.
I don't feel like what I got was worth it. After tax and 15% tip, my club sandwich and side minestrone soup was $26. Inflation hitting hard!

Very few options for people who are lactose intolerant or vegan as nearly all menu items have cheese.",Juice & Java Cafe

4005,Rhiannon B,3 months ago, 1 star ,"They don‚Äôt pay their employees if they don‚Äôt have to, apparently (I opened a labour board dispute and won and they STILL didn‚Äôt pay me, a former employee came in when I was working there and said they did her dirty as well as another review here has another employee saying the same)‚Ä¶they also bought pastries from a local cafe/pie place (now closed) and repeatedly froze & thawed them out to sell at full price as a daily business practice - one of many cut corners. I wouldn‚Äôt eat any of the food. If you‚Äôre disabled, green or naive definitely keep on looking for a job, it‚Äôs not worth it - this couple will be mean to you and/or take advantage.",Juice & Java Cafe
4006,Maliha K.,3 months ago, 3 stars ,"Not too bad, if I‚Äôm being honest not my FAVOURITE coffee shop on the beaches because I feel like the coffee is sometimes not fresh and the matcha drinks are 98% milk and 2% matcha. I do however love the service and their baked stuff, brownies and cookies are great here!! If you‚Äôre looking to get their salads though I would probably not.. there‚Äôs better salad other places around. Great customer service though, super friendly people, just not too good for their actual drinks :( Not worth the price, sorry!!",Juice & Java Cafe
4007,Jim W,3 months ago, 3 stars ,It's fine. Been here twice and the food is not worth the price but it was fine. The crepe menu looks good but the sandwich board is approaching fine dining prices for basic sandwiches. It seems to be busy with an older local clientele. The way their stock is stored is quite odd. It was very clean but cluttered in layout.,Juice & Java Cafe
4008,Eri Maeda,4 months ago, 5 stars ,The prices on the menu are increase and no longer matching on their website but still the best crapes on the Beach!,Juice & Java Cafe
4009,Fiona e,4 months ago, 1 star ,Horrible woman. I was told to ‚Äúnot move around and sit down‚Äù after I went upstairs to look around and connect to the wifi. Also their bagels are half the size of regular bagels and they are charging 5$ more then the bagel place in my neighbourhood Yonge and Eglinton.,Juice & Java Cafe
4010,Kara Beharry,5 months ago, 5 stars ,"Really enjoyed my experience at this Cafe. The name is misleading as they offer lots of food items. Oh well, after a 30km bike ride my appetite was definitely satiated with one of their savory crepe, hot sandwich, and delicious chai tea latte. Huge shout-out for making that great cup of chai. It was yum-o! Will definitely come back.",Juice & Java Cafe

We came to the place right before they were closing and ordered 1 cup of americano and 1 cappuccino, paid $10 for the order and americano was beyond disgusting! They were rushing to close at 4:40 and felt like they didn‚Äôt change the coffee from the previous client and made this ‚Äúbrown water‚Äù for my order. I couldn‚Äôt drink this absolutely gross ‚Äúdrink‚Äù and had to just poor it out! üëéüèª",Juice & Java Cafe

4027,Olivia Morgan,a year ago, 1 star ,Staff is not friendly & coffee is overrated. I dropped my coffee in the store after I paid $7.00 for a coffee and I tipped. They made me buy another one.

First time, we ordered the stuffed peppers with meat to take home - and oh my gosh so yummy and full of flavor. Second time, ordered the Cubano sandwich and the smoked salmon crepe. The Cubano is perfect, very yummy and the crepe is well balanced with smoked salmon, cream cheese, onion and capers. Definitely will be back to try other items. They‚Äôre also very nice people.

I thought it would be fresh considering it was a $10 crepe - but I can tell when it‚Äôs defrosted frozen strawberries.

It's silly. And given the price you charged for it, a pickle or a bit of coleslaw on the side would have made up for the bland cheese.

The staff are also very forgetful -had to remind them a few times of my order and that I was waiting. Today I ordered my first ""meal"". 9$ (plus tip). For the sandwich, they used the last bottom pieces of the bread (you know the tiny pieces at the front and end of a loaf of bread?) and gave me 4 pieces saying they were mini sandwiches. Not to mention they were over toasted/slightly burnt to the point where biting down to them cut my gums. I literally could have made this sandwich at home for less than I paid. It's really a shame because the atmosphere is nice but that does not excuse them from delivering good food. it just is not somewhere I would ever recommend a friend to go to if they wanted a decent sandwich... or smoothie apparently (refer to the other 1 star review).",Juice & Java Cafe

I asked for a Berry Mango smoothie with almond milk and I got a very weak tasting drink with barely any fruit and extremely pail in colour.  I had trouble believing any berries were even used because the drink was so pale. Last time I checked strawberries were RED and mangos are ORANGE so why was my smoothie almost colourless??? I quickly came back with my smoothie to complain, and  the response I got from the guy behind the counter was so disappointing. He shrugged his shoulders and said ""sorry"". Claimed he put berries in it and that was the end of the conversation. Didn't do anything to rectify the situation. For the hefty price that it cost, (PLUS TIP!!!)

5016,Maria Mejia,a month ago, 2 stars ,"Heard a lot of people recommended the coffee from this cafe and I FINALLY made my visit! üòúMos Mos Coffee is located in Downtown Toronto and they serve a variety of coffee and pastriesüíï (lots of cute donuts, all calling out to me!) This time, I got‚Ä¶.

‚òïÔ∏èCandamom Chai Latt√© ‚òïÔ∏è
I actually have not tried this latte, I was looking for something that has no sugar and the waiter recommended this to me! ü•∞It is one of my favourite now, I will definitely come back and get it again! ü§≠The Chai flavour is not as heavy as I thought it would be and every sip I drank was very soothing. üòãIf you are looking for something with no sugar but more on the milky side, this is definitely something you should try out! ü§†

üçã Lemon Poppyseed Loaf üçã
This was calling out to me, I am totally a fan of lemon poppyseed loaf. üòãTheir loaf was very yummy and rich in lemon flavour! It is more on the sweeter side and I wish there were more lemon flavour but totally loved it! ü§†

Other than Lattes, they also serve different coffees like flat white, Americano. üíïI have heard that their Matcha latte is very very good but they cannot do no sugar so I did not get to try this time! üëÄWill definitely come back for the Candamom Chai Latte!üòå

Thank you for yummy treats! ü§ç",Mos Mos Coffee

5018,aimee l,2 months ago, 5 stars ,"I came to the coffee shop since I had a couple hours to spare and wanted to study and do some work. Their wifi has a bunch of sites blocked which meant I only had access to my email. All of my google docs were not accessible and my online drive for school was also not accessible. For the price of the coffee I would at least expect some basic wifi connection. When I spoke with the manager all she said was that she could not help and that its not their wifi thats the problem, that its probably the site or my computer. Which is not true due to me being able to access my work and school from my phone using my data and later being able to access it with no issues at another coffee shop. Clearly they don't care about customer experience.",Mos Mos Coffee

I would have given them 5 stars but, the female behind the counter was not in a good mood...you're in the customer service business try to act like you like your job or at least be nice. When asked where the vegan donuts are don't just point, use your vocal chords. Anyways, the coffee was great; flavourful,  smoky and full of nutty and caramel notes and perfectly bitter. The ""Bloomers"" vegan donuts are amazing! Fluffy but dense and delicious.  I had the maple donut and it was fantabulous! I'd be back for the product but not the service.",Mos Mos Coffee

They have a wide drink selection and the staff there are very courteous. I go so often that the staff know my coffee preference by heart! And Helen, one of the baristas, makes an effort to memorize every customer's name thus making each interaction very personal which I LOVE!

I just think I visited on an off day for them. I love their drink selection and the variety of options for coffee and tea. The cookies are really delicious and fresh! I also loved how fluffy and big the vegan donut was. Although, I may have gotten the wrong flavour; I let them choose for me, and the one I received had a very tart, strong, sweet, fruitiness to it that just wouldn't sit right with me as I personally enjoy more mellow flavours. I also ordered the mango Chai latte with soy milk. That also didn't really work with me for similar reasons... but I will make another visit very soon and make some safer choices and adjust my review accordingly if the experience improves!",Mos Mos Coffee

5202,Amy Truong,3 years ago, 3 stars ,"Easily some of the best chai lattes I've ever had! Lots of cafes with mediocre chai lattes go overboard with the cinnamon or the milk, but the ones here taste very balanced.

I had the cardamom and mango ones and they were both very delicious, with the rich taste of chai permeating the whole drink. I like how there's a complex aftertaste - you can taste the milk, the chai and your flavour of choice.

Note that the sugar level and toppings are adjustable, which is great for a little bit of customization. I personally found half sugar the right amount of sugar.

Also: my pickup order was packed with care and the staff was very friendly. 90% of cafes here don't give me a tray or paper bag unless I ask, but I got both without any prompting. Great service!",Mos Mos Coffee

6012,Athena Campbell,3 weeks ago, 4 stars ,"I've been to this location  many times the last 3 years. I have to say the quality of food and drinks has gotten better. It is a Japanese style cafe. They offer matcha lattes, roll cakes, cheesecakes, pastries, and lunch options. I usually stop by for a quick drink and pastry.

During the pandemic, I felt that the espresso based drinks were watery and pastries were stale. But after 2 visits in the last 30 days, I can say that the quality has improved significantly. I had a decaf latte, and the espresso was full-bodied and aromatic. I ordered a croissant, and it was soft, buttery, and fresh. I observed that their pastries were made in-house because I saw two bakers actively working away. I'm glad they have worked on their products, and it is reflected in their quality.

My total for a latte and croissant came up to $10, which is going to be pricey for some, but it is the norm for downtown coffeeshops. They have narrow bench style seating along the cafe and a community table. It can become busy and crowded, and the entrance area can be packed. Making it difficult to find seating or figure out which line to stand in to place an order.

On the bonus side, they have a ""Happy hour"" of their own for house made drinks.  You get 50% off the same drink that you ordered earlier in the day. You just have to have your copy of the receipt as proof.",NEO COFFEE BAR
6013,Flawnson Tong,3 weeks ago, 5 stars ,"Really cute coffee store with a really nice ambiance. Their treats are so yummy and their coffee was one of the best in the city.

6014,Jarrett Smalley,4 weeks ago, 3 stars ,"Good matcha lattes (they use a good oat milk too) albeit pricey, 7.50 for a large. It comes naturally sweetened to the right amount for my taste. The store gets pretty busy during the days.",NEO COFFEE BAR

Matcha is very strong with heavy umami, be warned if that isnt your cup of tea

Many hours spent here studying and working.

Staff is always friendly as well",NEO COFFEE BAR
6022,Marta Melinda Pap,a month ago, 5 stars ,This coffee shop offers tasty speciality drinks and baked goodies. Their cookies and muffins are good. Customer service is good and fast. The inside of the store is pretty spacious and clean. They have tables and seats on the side walk. The location is good for university students and office works but not ideal for drivers. I would visit if I want to socialize and treat myself or a friend.,NEO COFFEE BAR
6023,Alina Konstantinovna,a month ago, 5 stars ,"I give them 4 stars as the coffee and dessert I had were really good and the vibe was really nice. Definitely a good place to chat and catch up with friends over cafe drinks and Japanese inspired desserts. Service was also really nice and the washroom is kept clean.

They lose a star as they really don‚Äôt encourage any kind of laptop work which is evident in the way the space is designed as well as how their wifi works.

Majority of the tables are small and can only fit a laptop. They have one large table space if you need to use a mouse but that‚Äôs if there is space since larger groups typically take that space.

During the week they do allow laptop use (on weekends and statutory holidays laptops aren‚Äôt allowed) but they only allow you to connect to their wifi for 1hr. After an hour the wifi craps out and you won‚Äôt be able to renew your wifi time, at least that was my experience for both my laptop and mobile device.

If you‚Äôre looking for a space to work on your laptop for over an hour while having coffee/light bites during the week, this is not the place for you.",NEO COFFEE BAR

6041,Kate Connors,3 months ago, 5 stars ,"RECOMMENDATION - Overall, if you want light snacks that don't overwhelm you and a place to chill, this will be right in your alley.

Food  - I got the Egg Salad Sando, Black Tea, and Basque Cheese Cake. Out of the three, the one I enjoyed the most was the Cheesecake. The other two fell flat for me. It was just standard, light snacks. Not memorable, but not bad.

Service - Great! Quick, professional and friendly. They were swamped and were working non-spot. You have lovely people working there.

Ambiance - Lots of seating to gather to talk to friends. I saw a bunch of people able to chill and chat. I love the atmosphere, and it boosted the place for me.

Accessibility: Getting in was a bit dicey, and the seating was very cramped. However, everything was on the first floor.

EDIT - Added an extra star for their reply and willingness to change. Most companies don't do that! :)",NEO COFFEE BAR

I went in wanting a croissant and when I first saw it in the display, I ignored my first thoughts that it looked kind of deflated and very small, especially for almost $5.

The coffee was pretty good. A pretty standard Americano and there's a station for your milk and sugar by the door.

The almond croissant might be the worst I've ever had. First up, it's a narrow shape and small, not wider than even a standard credit card (see pic for reference). Second, the texture was like a dense tortilla because there were no layers inside which I suspect is because the dough wasn't proofed and collapsed while baking (see pics for reference).  Third, the flavour was so off. It had no almond extract aroma or much flavour at all. Instead, because the croissant sits beside the rosemary cheddar croissant in the display, my croissant took on all the essence of sharp cheddar and rosemary and it was so off putting.

I've heard good things about their cakes but I don't recommend their croissants at all.",NEO COFFEE BAR

The Sakura and Matcha lattes were quite nice, but I felt like the matcha flavour was lacking, slightly on the weaker side. The cherry blossom flavour was overpowered by the raspberry and ultimately just tasted like a raspberry latte with a hint of Sakura, and was a little too sweet for me. Overall for my first time there I did enjoy everything",NEO COFFEE BAR

It‚Äôs a shame because they used to be a great place for regular coffee with premium beans.  Now, you need to just have an espresso or milk based espresso coffee which is basically the same as everywhere else.  Normal.

6168,Conrad Chan,11 months ago, 2 stars ,"(Translated by Google) This coffee shop located on Bay St in downtown Toronto is actually a branch. I remember going to the old shop in the early years. It is near George Brown College, and the old shop is relatively small.
This branch has a lot of atmosphere. As soon as you enter the store, you can feel the atmosphere of Japanese simplicity. Vertical grain wood strips are used as wall decoration, which is beautiful, chic and tasteful. There are enough guests, and the characteristic wooden table with log design is very large, and the whole feeling is very comfortable.
The cashier area is big enough, and the clerk is busy making coffee.
The eye-catching ones are colorful Japanese cake desserts. The roll cake selection is mouth-watering, and I immediately ordered a piece of [Maple Walnut Roll Cake] and added a cup of latte. Sit down and enjoy!
The cake looks good, the cream is not too sweet, and the taste is okay. The latte is smooth!
‚ùáÔ∏èIn general, I feel that both the environment and the production are pretty good. Many people take out desserts, next time you can try puffs and other Western-style buns. Good looks are pleasing to the eye!

I see not everybody agrees with the no-devices policy at certain times and the limited wifi, but I see it as a great and necessary way to keep customers moving and not taking up a seat for hours after buying one coffee. Even with those policies, it can be hard to find a seat with all the people using their laptops.",NEO COFFEE BAR

Service depends on who you‚Äôre being served by but overall it‚Äôs decent. The food and drinks are good and I love how they differentiate themselves from other coffee shops.

I just wish the tables of the seats around the wall where larger.

Also, they do have a changing table in the washroom, which makes a big difference if you're a parent and come with your baby üöº

The tables are insanely small (with the exception of one large table) so don't even think about going their to do work or study. it gets quite busy, so you'll have to be lucky when looking for a table too.

It was alright, it needed sugar, but that was on me because I just assumed it came with sugar, so it was a bit bitter. They also didn't really have a large variety of drinks, but that's alright. The cafe was very cute, and you should visit.",NEO COFFEE BAR

6290,Janet Yao,a year ago, 4 stars ,"I am a local here, so I used to go here alot. I can't even count how many times I visited this place. I used to love this place and  their coffee and I still love it, but I had several unpleasent experiences these days.

Their baristas were used to be polite and nice, but now they've changed. I asked for an iced americano and the barista didn't hear it right so they made a wrong coffee (an iced latte). I was okay with that and asked to make it again for me. But they never apologized or asked for a refund unless I told them to. I know it is just a few dollars but this is not right.. You should've gone ahead and asked your customer first that you charged more because you got wrong orders.
I got a refund and paid a right amount again, but the fact that I had to raise this up by myself without hearing any apologies from them is very disappointing.

I went this place a week later again to grab a coffee but the lady who worked there was not polite and nice at all. She was just staring at me when I stood in front of the cashier to order. What an awkward moment! She didn't asked me what to orser so I just told her my drinks and food. She didn't say a word...I don't feel welcomed in this place anymore and feel ignored. I understand that people have bad days, busy days or whatsoever but you should not bring your mood to your workplace and express that feelings to your customers. That's very unprofessional. I might not go back to this place for a while and instead will go to Jimmy's because their staffs are great and very professional.",NEO COFFEE BAR

Plastic labels should not go onto a pastry that is made to eat. I am still giving NEO a 4 star because I believe their things are tasty. But the Tiramisu was poorly executed.

What really stands out to me at this location above every other cafe in the area is the service. Every visit is met with a warm, friendly welcome. The baristas give their undivided attention to each person who comes to the store, even if they are busy! It also doesn't take long for them to prep orders. They seem to be welcome to trying out customizations (provided that you aren't expecting extra ingredients for free of course). They sell coffee and a variety of Japanese teas, as they are a Japanese caf√©, by the cup and by the package. I personally enjoy the Kabusecha, and Iced Matcha/Hojicha Lattes with their Housemade Vanilla Syrup. They sell a few Japanese-inspired pastries, like croissants, cookies, muffins, with Japanese flavours like matcha, yuzu, etc. While they are good, none of them stand out to me. In terms of more filling food, they do sell sandwiches. Having tried their selection several times, I can confirm that I do not really like them as I find them to be too salty.",NEO COFFEE BAR

Tried a lot of pastries and coffee/tea lattes from this place over the past year thanks to covid.

Recommend:

2. Espresso. Their beans are delicious and baristas know how to pull a perfect shot.
3. Cookies
Matcha cookies and dark chocolate sea salt! If you don't like overly sweet cookies, you will love cookies from Neo!

Roll cakes- so inconsistent when it comes to quality???? Sometimes they are amazing sometimes they are soggy and gross. Hope they can do betty quality control?

DRINKS: the Matcha Latte I ordered is a bit plain, couldn't taste the matcha flavor in it. Not bad but nothing special.

6384,Jensen,3 years ago, 4 stars ,"Cute Japanese coffee shop! Love the clean and minimal aesthetic. Beautiful cafe for IG photos esp. since they have pretty big windows so the lighting is pretty good. Compared to their other location, this one seems much busier and there aren't as many seats so would recommend going during off hours to avoid the crowd or be prepared to wait a bit for a spot. I've tried quite a few of their pastries and cakes and don't think there have been any that I disliked but their monthly specials are much more memorable than their daily pastries and cakes. Neo is on the pricier side, but I think it's worth it given the quality and atmosphere.

On my most recent trip, I got their March special, the matcha yuzu tiramisu. It was absolutely delicious!  The yuzu takes center stage for this dessert; the matcha is more subtle and adds a nice earthiness to complement the tart flavour from the yuzu and sweetness from the cream. Love how the yuzu cuts the heaviness of the cream and adds such a refreshing flavour! Perfect dessert to celebrate the warm Spring weather! My only complaint is the size... I wish it was triple the size! Could eat at least three cups of these!  So yummy! ‚Å£

The friendly gent brewing the bean made such a good Americano, I had to stay and have another. Second one was iced since it was so hot out, perfect.
I mentioned to him how I liked that it wasn‚Äôt very acidic, and he pointed out some of the reasons behind it, which were very cool to learn.
Followed that up with the mixed berry muffin I had been eyeing earlier. It had a PROPER amount of berries, which is just the way I like it.
Even managed to get a good amount of work and reading done while listening to the very chill jazz playing in the background.

I‚Äôve been here several times in the last couple of months because I wanted to give them a chance but nope, still the same awful service every time.

I was just there and the person serving me clearly had no interest in being there and shows no service etiquette. My standards are not high, but all I‚Äôm saying is I‚Äôve received better service at Burger King.

I give them 2/5 because at the very least they have a good selection of food which most coffee shops nowadays don‚Äôt seem to offer.

Our decision to still make attempts to stop and enjoy the coffee were based on other reviews and how highly other thought about the place. I found it really average. The place is cute and you can find seating but its awkward at times. I think the owner needs to review seating arrangements - there are definately ways to maximize space without compromising a cozy atmosphere. The coffee was good but was average. I got the rocket fuel coffee and a oatmeal cookie - just average and nothing else to write about. My guess is that its a good  neighborhood spot as it became a bit busy with 1 served who managed drinks, orders, and cash. However, I don't think I'll go out of my way again.",Remarkable Beans

7115,Sydney Westgate,4 years ago, 5 stars ,"My family and I are frequent customers at the Bean both in Leslieville and the Beaches. Not only is the coffee AMAZING (they roast their own btw) but the desserts are delicious. I suggest trying the ButterTart, they are the best in town! They also have a wide range of gluten free products and some vegan which is nice to have :)

As I said before, the coffee is wonderful. The owner's, as well as one very charming barista with a mighty fine beard, roast their own beans in house. The coffee is strong, not acidic and smooth. Rocket Fuel is my go-to! The espresso is creamy with caramel undertones. Just by the taste of your drink, you know the roasting is done expertly and the staff are well trained when it come's to steaming milk and pouring espresso shots. The staff are also extremely friendly and quirky - don't let the sometimes sarcastic wit steer you away! The Remarkable Bean is certainly unique and the staff are no different. There is jazz music playing in the background and velvet purple, yellow and red pillows.

Everyone who goes to the Bean is also kind. You can certainly tell that in the Leslieville location, almost everyone is a regular and the owners are familiar with many of their customers. Speaking of the owners, the Bean is a family run company and if you are grabbing a coffee from either location you are bound to see them. They care about their store, their customers and their staff. They are, in my opinion, a very ""hallmark"" type of family and if you know hallmark, that means they are kind, charming and passionate about what they do.

If I was going to recommend a coffee shop in Toronto to someone, my first suggestion is always the Remarkable Bean! It may be located outside of the downtown core, but it's worth the trip! My family doesn't live in the area but still choose to swing by the bean when in need of a coffee-fix. Trust me when I say you can't go wrong :)

ALSO they have comedy on friday nights!! BONUS",Remarkable Beans

Wouldn't recommend it for sitting and reading or working/studying however- the music is consistently awful, never changed (I've heard the same group of old CDs repeat 3 times in one afternoon type of thing) and volume is set very loud. I bring my noise cancelling headphones and try and make-do because I love the place so much lol",Remarkable Beans

The barista actually took the time to explain each bean to me, from harvesting to drying to roasting to flavour profile. EACH bean!! He made sure I picked the right one.",Remarkable Beans

2 experiences here:
One during this past winter; the staff was excellent, friendly and made a great coffee! we had lattes and sausage rolls to refuel after a long (and cold) run. We were able to find a seat even though it was busy.
One during this past summer; Iced tea was really good (they brew it as you order) but the staff seemed to be new and a bit unsure of them self. The drinks took a long time.",Remarkable Beans

The day we were there was a pretty slow day so the comedian behind the counter was keeping the spirits light and entertaining us. He made a damn good iced coffee as well. We tried some sweets; a brownie and butter tart, and although the butter tart was a bit too dry the brownie was great. We went to the back patio which was empty to our surprise, on such a nice day. Would go here again!",Remarkable Beans

However, the last time we were here, the service took forever (we learned there was only one cook in the kitchen) and the food took forever to arrive and was sadly mediocre.

This does not have to be fatal, but the restaurant needs to make some improvements to regain our trust.",The Beacher Cafe

9058,Ryan Magder,8 months ago, 2 stars ,"Stopped by for Father's day around 10am.  Sign outside the restaurant mentioned a 25-minute wait for food, no problem, we continued on in and got a table with no issue. After ordering we waited an hour for food. Food arrived cold (eggs, bacon, sausages, potatoes), we ate it because we were starving at that point, understanding that if we sent it back we would likely be waiting a long time for the food to return.

Manager (we assume, she is decision maker for hiring) asks how the food was. Gave her our honest feedback about the long wait and food quality, I'm honestly not sure how the food could arrive cold unless it was sitting at the window for a while. For what it's worth, the service was good and we were able to get refills on our drinks (2nd star for service).

I understand restaurants being understaffed (sure, it happens!), but I'd rather that they communicate it realistically beforehand (i.e., write on the sign out front the wait for food is 45 minutes - 1 hour). We heard other nearby tables with small children asking about the arrival of their food. We were told they'd give it 200% next time, no amendments to the bill were made. Sorry, there will probably not be a next time.",The Beacher Cafe

I was fine to leave it at that and not review but I asked for a refill on my coffee in a to go cup and after paying for my bad meal in full, she told she would have to ring up a new coffee.

The interior in winter months tends to be below room temperature, but more than that, the portions have become noticeably smaller, particularly the home fries with the eggs benedict - easily half the size the order was previously. The past two times have been bad experiences. One we waited almost an hour for our food which was also disappointing and yesterday, May 20, we tried again and my wife's omelette was stone cold, as were her home fries. We complained the the waitress took it back to the kitchen and when it returned, yes it was hot but flavourless. She said the best tasting part of her meal was the toast. That's it Beacher... we're done. Never coming back... lots of other places in the Beach that would be happy to have our business and give us value for money. AVOID",The Beacher Cafe

I totally get it, with current economic environment and inflation on everything, it is necessary to charge clients the extra amount to ensure your restaurant's survival.  However the only suggestion is perhaps to make a note on the menu stating the % charged to stay a float or have your friendly waiting staff to inform the table. I would be happy to pay for it, it just came to me on my bill as a surprise a had no idea how much was being charged.  Other than that, I am happy to be a patron again at your establishment, b/c I love that quiche you served today.  Thank you!! Would be happy to join the restaurant again soon!",The Beacher Cafe

Food was alright but not great for the price. Eggs in my order were made incorrectly, and I had to send them back sadly. The home fries are huge chunks of soft potato, some not even cut. The bacon and eggs were extremely oily‚Ä¶ a bit disappointing.

Our server was nice, and tried to be as accommodating as possible, but she seemed really frazzled. She had to drag around a huge sandwich board with the specials with her all over the restaurant? We felt bad she had to do that just to tell us the specials‚Ä¶ ??

Lastly a few feet away from us on a table in our section was a huge box of cat litter‚Ä¶ so strange. Definitely weird to have out during brunch service.",The Beacher Cafe

We were told that the BLT on a croissant would have to be on bread because they ran out of croissants. This was about 40 minutes after we had ordered it. People who arrived after us were being served long before us and several had even paid and left while we were waiting for our food. We were presented with bills that were full price. When we said we would not pay the full amount after waiting so long, we were brought bills that were 25% off. We asked to speak to a manager but we‚Äôre told no manager was working that day.

We will never forget when we first moved in the neighbourhood, this is the first place we went to and in excitement in sharing that we just bought our new home, the owner treated our entire family to ice cream and said ""welcome to the neighbourhood.""  The small gesture meant so much to us as it was so genuine. Over the years, as our child was born we always felt so welcomed there and Ashely (our favourite server) had such a warm, natural rapport with our little guy and as he grew older in his tots they would always wave to eachother as they passed by. We really appreciate the community feels you create for your customers. To us you are family! Thank you for your excellence in customer service and your kindness.",The Beacher Cafe
9170,Quad Mods FPV,2 years ago, 5 stars ,"Have enjoyed many breakfasts at the Beacher Cafe but have recently noticed that although the price of the menu stays the same, but the qualitty of the meals have not.  Especially the Healthy Breakfast that included a choice of avocado or cottage cheese.  The last 3 times we have been at the Beacher Cafe to support the local businesses, we have been told that the avocado is no longer available.  If the avocado is no longer available, then the price should either be lower or offer an additional poached egg.  That's my opinion!",The Beacher Cafe

.
The food was great. We tried the all day breakfast, avocado egg benedict special, chocolate mousse cake, and an apple crumble cheesecake. Our server was exceptionally friendly, as were the other servers who checked in to provide refills of coffee or water and remove our plates.
.
The restaurant is very family-friendly. There were groups of seniors, parents with young children, couples on dates, and even a group of younger women out to brunch together. It was very welcoming and the overall experience was simply comforting.

I would definitely recommend stopping in to try one of their specials next time you're on Queen Street East!",The Beacher Cafe

Veggie Burger good but forget onions and mushrooms brought in side dish cold. 150.00 4 4 chesse sandwiches 1 veggie burger 4 drinks. Sandwich was supposed to be on Texas Toast and was on thin cheap wheat toast. Was excited drove from Niagara Falls very disappointed when we got there pleasant environment. When I expressed how cold all the food was how long were you had waited and that it was incorrect toast no offer of compensation was made or apology I noticed anybody that has a complaint here many restaurants come back on with the owner of a reason complaints an offer to try to make it up so you'll come back I need to find a new restaurant in the beaches I will never return and no matter how many good reviews they have here I should just people don't go there because I don't know why anyone would give him a the food was cold the portions were small the service was poor there was high and there was a fly right around our food the entire time and nobody turn on the ceiling fans on a warm summer day to distract the flies from bothering the food. All in all a disappointing an overpriced meal. No one mines paying for a meal if the food is good in the service is nice. The only thing I can say good about this restaurant is it was cute in the inside and had a lovely patio. Don't go there if you're a vegetarian or I suspect even a meat eater and you want a good meal. Feel free to go there if you want to pay $150 for a $30 meal but isn't great.

It‚Äôs a strange colour and kind of clear, like it‚Äôs a lot of cream of tartar, and totally flavourless. I asked for an English muffin with the benny instead of a croissant but they gave me a croissant anyway and it was not a pleasant combo. The pancakes were also very bland.

9332,Brian Sopher,3 years ago, 5 stars ,"The breakfast here is good staff is on point in the morning. The one star is for just about the worst dinner expereince ive ever had anywhere in the world. The worst service pure rudness and unprofessional. It was almost like they didnt want us to come in.

The food was such a pale comparsion to the breakfast/brunch they do, litterly night and day. I wish i remember to take a photo, i looked at the plate and just asked for the bill. I wanted to just walk out which i should have.  ""Soluvlaki chicken dinner"" The plate had 5 tiny pi√®ces of chicken spread out like islands and cold fries im guessing they we're frozen?!??? It looked frost burnt.

Finally No way the owner knows this is going on. No one in there right mind would run a restaurant like this on a street with such a high reputation.",The Beacher Cafe

9624,C√©line Verrier-Fletcher,6 years ago, 4 stars ,"I assume that most people go here for the all day breakfast and brunch stuff but my wife and I went  here on a weekday for lunch.  We ordered some pretty simple menu items which the waitress agreed were good choices.  But for drinks we thought we would try the smoothies.  Hilarious. These were more like slushees with a fake fruit flavour and no real sign of fruit that I could see.  The arches make better smoothies.    My wife had the fish and chips and I had the club sandwich which boasts ""real turkey"" as an ingredient.   Sadly when the sandwich came I was hugely disappointed.  Basically three pieces of ordinary brown toast with this really thinly slice turkey that was seared on the flat top.  The peameal bacon was very thin and seared as well.  Nice lettuce and tomato but an OK effort at best.  Not recommended.   The fries on my order were fresh but had an odd odour like cheap oil... not pleasant.   My wife's fish and chips looked ok but generally we like more fish than batter.  The fish seemed a bit underdone for me.  It is again an OK effort but not terribly good.   We were given glasses of water and asked if this was tap water.  Yup.. not filtered like most restaurants today.   Yuck.. undrinkable.
I am sure this place pleases the families who come here later in the morning but I would suggest this is not really a proper restaurant for a decent meal other than the all day breakfast stuff.",The Beacher Cafe

Value for ok food is low, because it's priced high for what you're getting. ex. simple 'not chunky' grilled chicken on a bun with what they call a salad (which is really a handful of mixed greens) is $14. If value was high for ok food, it wouldn't be as bad. But not even that. Portions not high either for low quality food.",The Beacher Cafe

We do work with many bakeries and other kitchens who do not process gluten and those items are pre-packaged and sealed. Our house menu does process gluten and is labelled as such. Thank you again and do reach out if we can help with anything else.",The Haven Low-Carb Cafe
10025,Sami Pritchard,9 months ago, 5 stars ,Love this spot! Such a cute cafe and their coffee is always delicious!

10039,Mark Stevenson,a year ago, 5 stars ,"Good food, ok prices. Most of the keto products are expensive which is to be expected- but the quality does make up for it. The tiramisu they sell by ketolibriyum is absolutely amazing.

The only downside is it's a little too far away and way out of the way and the hours are too short so if you need to get something after a 9-5 job in downtown Toronto, store would be closed by then.

Would really help if they had delivery of some kind.",The Haven Low-Carb Cafe

Their croissants was OK, not the best.",White Rabbit Caffe

Or at-least have a backup plan. Tea was good but not worth five dollars. Pastries however, were phenomenal and I thoroughly enjoyed their raspberry croissant.

The atmospheres is really cute and service was quick and kind so I may try to come early to get a table and study for the day, but not to sure if it‚Äôs worth it.",White Rabbit Caffe
11005,Healani Norman,3 months ago, 4 stars ,"Very minimalistic coffee shop, I love it!!! The menu is easily compartmentalized so you're not spending twenty minutes deciding or even trying to locate what you want. I ordered the latte and my husband got the cappuccino, both of which came out with perfect micro foam. The croissant was on par being light and fluffy. We sat outside at one of the tables out front and people watched for a little while. Very lovely overall :)",White Rabbit Caffe
11006,A Dreamer (ASA),3 months ago, 4 stars ,"I don‚Äôt usually go to small cafes like this (I go to big mainstream ones) but coming to this one on a whim at 8AM on a rainy morning was very cathartic. I‚Äôm not in Toronto all the time, so in a dry corner outside I spent 10 mins trying to find a cafe open, as it was 7:30am and many came up and frankly I walked the distance to a few, to which I couldn‚Äôt find and or cafes that didn‚Äôt feel right. When I saw this one I was pulled in b/c the name and honestly I‚Äôm glad I made the walking trip in the cold that morning. I had a version of a green tea White Rabbit Caffe offered & it was very bitter but that‚Äôs green tea for you üòÇ it was a big cup, I spent an hour or so here with my air buds in and I was not bothered. A place to try for the vibes, friends.",White Rabbit Caffe

11014,Kathleene Sim,6 months ago, 5 stars ,"I've been searching for a cafe that opens early in the morning ~7AM on weekdays so I can spend some time having breakfast before I head over to work. I'd always known this caf√© existed but I never took the leap to visit until today, and I'm really glad I took that chance.

The exterior is tiny and unassuming, but when you come in, you're invited into a small, cozy space filled with greenery in the form of decor, and lots of seating. It's a very home-y atmosphere and has this unpolished vibe to it ‚Äì I liked it; it reminded me of a cafe I used to visit while in school.

I ordered a lavender latte and pistachio croissant. The barista was kind and helpful with describing the lavender latte, as I had some concerns. They were also able to sub in oat milk, as I'm a bit lactose intolerant.

I love lavender in theory, but any strong aromas of it truthfully turns me away. The latte I got was like the idea of lavender; the flavour was definitely there, but in a really subtle way, which is how I'd hoped it to be. The pistachio croissant was GREAT. They really didn't skimp on that filling.

I'll be back soon to try the rest of the menu!",White Rabbit Caffe

I have been to other caf√©s with to-go iced drink cups that look like plastic but are indeed compostable, but this one has a recyclable symbol.

He‚Äôd always smile, chat, and he remembered our orders and things we told him. People often talk about ‚Äúlocal gems‚Äù and this place is the dictionary definition of that term.

11055,Timothy K,a year ago, 2 stars ,"The White Rabb was really missing ""it"" (see photo).

The most disappointing part of this coffee shop was that it has high reviews (4.7) at the time of writing this. In reality this is a 2-3 star coffee shop. The flat white was overly milky and technically a latte -I would say it fell flat. The google listing writes ""sandwiches and salads"" but middle of the day they only had like, 5-6 croissants to chose from and there was a fly on them. If you want to eat, go elsewhere.

Edit: Saw the owner's reply below, unfortunately the review wasn't written the same day as the experience took place so I doubt the ""barista in training"" excuse (also because I only saw one employee on site that day (Tuesday Oct 12th, app. 11:30am) and I'm fairly certain the barista that served us was the owner) and, I do appreciate the offer of a free coffee but we had come to the establishment for the sandwiches and salads, hopefully you guys will have that in the future.",White Rabbit Caffe

That being said, post-COVID I have been semi-terrified by his utter lack of respect for the guidelines. The last five times I have passed by or gone into the store to get something the man has his mask either not covering his nostrils or not covering his mouth at all! I have seen other reviewers mention this behavior and also seen the owner reply with an excuse like ""you came in when the cafe was empty"" but he definitely still does this when plenty of people are in the store. I definitely go less than I did before COVID because of this behaviour. There are plenty of other cafes that are rule-abiding and that have products that are just as good.",White Rabbit Caffe
