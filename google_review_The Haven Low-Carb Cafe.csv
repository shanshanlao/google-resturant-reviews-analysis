The Haven Low-Carb Cafe,Queen St E,Diana Lopez hernandez,8 months ago, 5 stars ,"Unfortunately not fully gluten free anymore üòî FYI for celiacs... Hopefully it goes back to all GF ü§ûto avoid cross contamination and be safe again, kitchen is too small to be celiac safe with the menu changes. ‚Ä¶"
The Haven Low-Carb Cafe,Queen St E,Tyler Dias,8 months ago, 5 stars ,"Hi Katharine, while we appreciate you taking the time to leave us a review, we do still offer celiac friendly options. We do work with many bakeries and other kitchens who do not process gluten and those items are pre-packaged and sealed. Our house menu does process gluten and is labelled as such. Thank you again and do reach out if we can help with anything else."
The Haven Low-Carb Cafe,Queen St E,Sami Pritchard,9 months ago, 5 stars ,Love this spot! Such a cute cafe and their coffee is always delicious! They definitely stepped up their game in the Beaches by partnering with Muuse to offer a completely zero waste takeout experience in BEAUTIFUL reusable cups and I couldn't be happier! Kudos to you :)

The Haven Low-Carb Cafe,Queen St E,Avihai Fernbach,11 months ago, 5 stars ,Small and dainty coffee store by the beaches. The aesthetic is nice and the washroom is clean. The beans make for a good Americano. The baristas were very passionate explaining to me different beans.

The Haven Low-Carb Cafe,Queen St E,Mark Stevenson,a year ago, 5 stars ,"Good food, ok prices. Most of the keto products are expensive which is to be expected- but the quality does make up for it. The tiramisu they sell by ketolibriyum is absolutely amazing.

The only downside is it's a little too far away and way out of the way and the hours are too short so if you need to get something after a 9-5 job in downtown Toronto, store would be closed by then.

Would really help if they had delivery of some kind."
The Haven Low-Carb Cafe,Queen St E,Pamela Beharry,a year ago, 5 stars ,Thanks for your review and for supporting local. We are slowly introducing delivery and will be adding more items weekly. Team haven!

The Haven Low-Carb Cafe,Queen St E,Maxwell Amias,a year ago, 5 stars ,"Best spot to get coffee and a paleo, keto or gluten-free snack. The owners are so friendly and welcoming, and seem to have a unique bond with many of their customers. Love the vibe and the atmosphere and they are always willing to go the extra mile to order something special for you and change something because of dietary restrictions.  My favourite place to go now in the Beaches."
The Haven Low-Carb Cafe,Queen St E,ABINASH BASA,a year ago, 5 stars ,You're the best Monique :)
The Haven Low-Carb Cafe,Queen St E,Joy Chatfield,a year ago, 5 stars ,"I love this place!  We are gluten free and it is hard to find gluten free that isn't loaded with sugar.  It such a lovely little spot and I enjoy the friendly staff, love the owners.  The one thing that stands out the most though is the coffee!  I have had the same brand from other places, but it never tastes this good.  I will be back here often"

The Haven Low-Carb Cafe,Queen St E,Kimmy Burton,a year ago, 1 star ,Thankfully I don‚Äôt live too close to the Haven or I would absolutely be blowing all my money there. It‚Äôs such a treat to find a fully gluten-free cafe/store and feel safe ordering anything. The owners are lovely people and staff are always friendly. Their chicken sandwiches and breakfast sandwiches are fantastic - worth driving across the city! Whenever I find myself in the east end I make a point to stop by.
