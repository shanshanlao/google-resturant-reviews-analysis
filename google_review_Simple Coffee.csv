Nicole Rae,3 months ago, 5 stars ,"This was my first time visiting Simple Coffee and it was a great experience!  Jason, the Owner is super friendly and provides a warm welcome. I highly recommend the blueberry scone. It was not overly sweet which I liked.   I also really enjoyed the cappuccino I had.  I would definitely return."
Jarrod Nichols,3 months ago, 5 stars ,
Jens Christian Roth,3 months ago, 5 stars ,"Highly recommend!
Stumbled across this cute little coffee shop as I’m new to the area.
I opted in for an oat milk latte and almond croissant.
Latte was very nice and creamy (i would say velvet-like). The croissant was amazing, I was so surprised by how delicious it was, I will 100% be back."

Bubs Arcade Fighters,a year ago, 5 stars ,"Great little Gem. Tasty cappuccino, reasonable price, doesn't charge you extra for things such as almond milk. ☕ Cappuccinos are served considerably hotter than any other typical coffee shops. Which is a good thing👍. Service was pretty fast as well. Oh, and extra shot of espresso is just +50c 🌟🌟🌟 …"

Found myself with a much needed cup of coffee and nice chat with the staff member. Cheered me right up and again later on in the day when I ate the delicious peanut brittle cookie I picked up as well!

Highly recommend!"
