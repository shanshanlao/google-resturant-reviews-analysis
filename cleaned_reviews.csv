136,Bud's Coffee,Queen St E,A Cartier,4 years ago,4,"I feel like the Beaches are purposely keeping Bud's under wraps and not letting anyone know about this spot. I had no idea about Bud's and was dreading of finding a good cup in a new spot. With the overwhelming positives for this spot, I stepped into their door and was happy to Sam James beans being used.

Recently, it sounds like they moved to a bigger spot and still making a great cup. It is still very busy... even on a lazy Saturday afternoon, there was no tables freed up and the constant line up was in and out of the place. It has a great friendly vibe and everyone here is quite warm with each other. It's clear that Bud's has made themselves part of the community because of the number of personal conversations between patrons or the staff and patrons. This was really nice to see. I guess Toronto can be friendly after all!

I have to appreciate how they use the good Canadian brands like Pluck and Cut Coffee to create their drinks. Nothing like supporting a good local. I think the baristas really know their drinks cause the flat whites we got were surpassing some of the well known coffee shops that sit on Toronto top 50.

Flat White with almond milk - The butter knife beans are just so good and Bud's did them right. This was a rich and robust coffee flavour with a touch of milkiness from the microfoamed milk. No acidity to make me wince. We decided to do the cashew and almond milk side by side taste test. I personally liked the almond milk more. I found it didn't influence the flat white as much and let the coffee flavour be more forward. I liked this one. 4/5

Flat White with cashew milk - I found the cashew milk version to have less of a coffee flavour... it definitely changed the taste. I would say it was a milkier flavour but more muted for sure. I did find cashew milk to be creamier than the almond milk but also weirdly enough, I touch more sweet? So if you're looking for the texture the most closest to cow's milk, this would probably be your favourite alternative milk. Kudos to Buds for offering more than one type of nut milk. 4/5

The staff are also very forgetful -had to remind them a few times of my order and that I was waiting. Today I ordered my first ""meal"". 9$ (plus tip). For the sandwich, they used the last bottom pieces of the bread (you know the tiny pieces at the front and end of a loaf of bread?) and gave me 4 pieces saying they were mini sandwiches. Not to mention they were over toasted/slightly burnt to the point where biting down to them cut my gums. I literally could have made this sandwich at home for less than I paid. It's really a shame because the atmosphere is nice but that does not excuse them from delivering good food. it just is not somewhere I would ever recommend a friend to go to if they wanted a decent sandwich... or smoothie apparently (refer to the other 1 star review).",neg,en,"['want', 'like', 'place', 'atmosphere', 'cozy', 'plus', 'occasion', 'come', 'basic', 'ingredient', 'juices', 'bread', 'milk', 'staff', 'forgetful', 'remind', 'time', 'order', 'wait', 'today', 'order', 'meal', 'plus', 'tip', 'sandwich', 'piece', 'bread', 'know', 'tiny', 'piece', 'end', 'loaf', 'bread', 'give', 'piece', 'say', 'mini', 'sandwich', 'mention', 'toast', 'slightly', 'burn', 'point', 'bite', 'cut', 'gum', 'literally', 'sandwich', 'home', 'pay', 'shame', 'atmosphere', 'nice', 'excuse', 'deliver', 'good', 'food', 'recommend', 'friend', 'want', 'decent', 'sandwich', 'smoothie', 'apparently', 'refer', 'star', 'review']",want like place atmosphere cozy plus occasion come basic ingredient juices bread milk staff forgetful remind time order wait today order meal plus tip sandwich piece bread know tiny piece end loaf bread give piece say mini sandwich mention toast slightly burn point bite cut gum literally sandwich home pay shame atmosphere nice excuse deliver good food recommend friend want decent sandwich smoothie apparently refer star review

340,The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,Ryan Magder,8 months ago,2,"Stopped by for Father's day around 10am.  Sign outside the restaurant mentioned a 25-minute wait for food, no problem, we continued on in and got a table with no issue. After ordering we waited an hour for food. Food arrived cold (eggs, bacon, sausages, potatoes), we ate it because we were starving at that point, understanding that if we sent it back we would likely be waiting a long time for the food to return.

Manager (we assume, she is decision maker for hiring) asks how the food was. Gave her our honest feedback about the long wait and food quality, I'm honestly not sure how the food could arrive cold unless it was sitting at the window for a while. For what it's worth, the service was good and we were able to get refills on our drinks (2nd star for service).

I was fine to leave it at that and not review but I asked for a refill on my coffee in a to go cup and after paying for my bad meal in full, she told she would have to ring up a new coffee.

466,The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,HeavenlyHund,3 years ago,1,Food cold poor service 12.00 for cold chesse sandwiches and frys no salad dressing asked 3 people before I received it and never asked what kind I wanted. Veggie Burger good but forget onions and mushrooms brought in side dish cold. 150.00 4 4 chesse sandwiches 1 veggie burger 4 drinks. Sandwich was supposed to be on Texas Toast and was on thin cheap wheat toast. Was excited drove from Niagara Falls very disappointed when we got there pleasant environment. When I expressed how cold all the food was how long were you had waited and that it was incorrect toast no offer of compensation was made or apology I noticed anybody that has a complaint here many restaurants come back on with the owner of a reason complaints an offer to try to make it up so you'll come back I need to find a new restaurant in the beaches I will never return and no matter how many good reviews they have here I should just people don't go there because I don't know why anyone would give him a the food was cold the portions were small the service was poor there was high and there was a fly right around our food the entire time and nobody turn on the ceiling fans on a warm summer day to distract the flies from bothering the food. All in all a disappointing an overpriced meal. No one mines paying for a meal if the food is good in the service is nice. The only thing I can say good about this restaurant is it was cute in the inside and had a lovely patio. Don't go there if you're a vegetarian or I suspect even a meat eater and you want a good meal. Feel free to go there if you want to pay $150 for a $30 meal but isn't great.

679,The Beacher Cafe,Queen St E,michael b,6 years ago,1,"I assume that most people go here for the all day breakfast and brunch stuff but my wife and I went  here on a weekday for lunch.  We ordered some pretty simple menu items which the waitress agreed were good choices.  But for drinks we thought we would try the smoothies.  Hilarious. These were more like slushees with a fake fruit flavour and no real sign of fruit that I could see.  The arches make better smoothies.    My wife had the fish and chips and I had the club sandwich which boasts ""real turkey"" as an ingredient.   Sadly when the sandwich came I was hugely disappointed.  Basically three pieces of ordinary brown toast with this really thinly slice turkey that was seared on the flat top.  The peameal bacon was very thin and seared as well.  Nice lettuce and tomato but an OK effort at best.  Not recommended.   The fries on my order were fresh but had an odd odour like cheap oil... not pleasant.   My wife's fish and chips looked ok but generally we like more fish than batter.  The fish seemed a bit underdone for me.  It is again an OK effort but not terribly good.   We were given glasses of water and asked if this was tap water.  Yup.. not filtered like most restaurants today.   Yuck.. undrinkable.

849,Remarkable Beans,Queen St E,Sydney Westgate,4 years ago,5,"My family and I are frequent customers at the Bean both in Leslieville and the Beaches. Not only is the coffee AMAZING (they roast their own btw) but the desserts are delicious. I suggest trying the ButterTart, they are the best in town! They also have a wide range of gluten free products and some vegan which is nice to have :)

As I said before, the coffee is wonderful. The owner's, as well as one very charming barista with a mighty fine beard, roast their own beans in house. The coffee is strong, not acidic and smooth. Rocket Fuel is my go-to! The espresso is creamy with caramel undertones. Just by the taste of your drink, you know the roasting is done expertly and the staff are well trained when it come's to steaming milk and pouring espresso shots. The staff are also extremely friendly and quirky - don't let the sometimes sarcastic wit steer you away! The Remarkable Bean is certainly unique and the staff are no different. There is jazz music playing in the background and velvet purple, yellow and red pillows.

Everyone who goes to the Bean is also kind. You can certainly tell that in the Leslieville location, almost everyone is a regular and the owners are familiar with many of their customers. Speaking of the owners, the Bean is a family run company and if you are grabbing a coffee from either location you are bound to see them. They care about their store, their customers and their staff. They are, in my opinion, a very ""hallmark"" type of family and if you know hallmark, that means they are kind, charming and passionate about what they do.

If I was going to recommend a coffee shop in Toronto to someone, my first suggestion is always the Remarkable Bean! It may be located outside of the downtown core, but it's worth the trip! My family doesn't live in the area but still choose to swing by the bean when in need of a coffee-fix. Trust me when I say you can't go wrong :)

Note that the sugar level and toppings are adjustable, which is great for a little bit of customization. I personally found half sugar the right amount of sugar.

1203,NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Fatima A.S,3 weeks ago,4,"I've been to this location  many times the last 3 years. I have to say the quality of food and drinks has gotten better. It is a Japanese style cafe. They offer matcha lattes, roll cakes, cheesecakes, pastries, and lunch options. I usually stop by for a quick drink and pastry.

During the pandemic, I felt that the espresso based drinks were watery and pastries were stale. But after 2 visits in the last 30 days, I can say that the quality has improved significantly. I had a decaf latte, and the espresso was full-bodied and aromatic. I ordered a croissant, and it was soft, buttery, and fresh. I observed that their pastries were made in-house because I saw two bakers actively working away. I'm glad they have worked on their products, and it is reflected in their quality.

My total for a latte and croissant came up to $10, which is going to be pricey for some, but it is the norm for downtown coffeeshops. They have narrow bench style seating along the cafe and a community table. It can become busy and crowded, and the entrance area can be packed. Making it difficult to find seating or figure out which line to stand in to place an order.

On the bonus side, they have a ""Happy hour"" of their own for house made drinks.  You get 50% off the same drink that you ordered earlier in the day. You just have to have your copy of the receipt as proof.",pos,en,"['location', 'time', 'year', 'quality', 'food', 'drink', 'get', 'well', 'japanese', 'style', 'cafe', 'offer', 'matcha', 'latte', 'roll', 'cake', 'cheesecake', 'pastry', 'lunch', 'option', 'usually', 'stop', 'quick', 'drink', 'pastry', 'pandemic', 'feel', 'espresso', 'base', 'drink', 'watery', 'pastry', 'stale', 'visit', 'day', 'quality', 'improve', 'significantly', 'decaf', 'latte', 'espresso', 'body', 'aromatic', 'order', 'croissant', 'soft', 'buttery', 'fresh', 'observe', 'pastry', 'house', 'see', 'baker', 'actively', 'work', 'away', 'glad', 'work', 'product', 'reflect', 'quality', 'total', 'latte', 'croissant', 'come', 'go', 'pricey', 'norm', 'downtown', 'coffeeshop', 'narrow', 'bench', 'style', 'seat', 'cafe', 'community', 'table', 'busy', 'crowd', 'entrance', 'area', 'pack', 'make', 'difficult', 'find', 'seat', 'figure', 'line', 'stand', 'place', 'order', 'bonus', 'happy', 'hour', 'house', 'drink', 'drink', 'order', 'early', 'day', 'copy', 'receipt', 'proof']",location time year quality food drink get well japanese style cafe offer matcha latte roll cake cheesecake pastry lunch option usually stop quick drink pastry pandemic feel espresso base drink watery pastry stale visit day quality improve significantly decaf latte espresso body aromatic order croissant soft buttery fresh observe pastry house see baker actively work away glad work product reflect quality total latte croissant come go pricey norm downtown coffeeshop narrow bench style seat cafe community table busy crowd entrance area pack make difficult find seat figure line stand place order bonus happy hour house drink drink order early day copy receipt proof

They lose a star as they really don‚Äôt encourage any kind of laptop work which is evident in the way the space is designed as well as how their wifi works.

Majority of the tables are small and can only fit a laptop. They have one large table space if you need to use a mouse but that‚Äôs if there is space since larger groups typically take that space.

During the week they do allow laptop use (on weekends and statutory holidays laptops aren‚Äôt allowed) but they only allow you to connect to their wifi for 1hr. After an hour the wifi craps out and you won‚Äôt be able to renew your wifi time, at least that was my experience for both my laptop and mobile device.

Service - Great! Quick, professional and friendly. They were swamped and were working non-spot. You have lovely people working there.

Ambiance - Lots of seating to gather to talk to friends. I saw a bunch of people able to chill and chat. I love the atmosphere, and it boosted the place for me.

I went in wanting a croissant and when I first saw it in the display, I ignored my first thoughts that it looked kind of deflated and very small, especially for almost $5.

The coffee was pretty good. A pretty standard Americano and there's a station for your milk and sugar by the door.

The almond croissant might be the worst I've ever had. First up, it's a narrow shape and small, not wider than even a standard credit card (see pic for reference). Second, the texture was like a dense tortilla because there were no layers inside which I suspect is because the dough wasn't proofed and collapsed while baking (see pics for reference).  Third, the flavour was so off. It had no almond extract aroma or much flavour at all. Instead, because the croissant sits beside the rosemary cheddar croissant in the display, my croissant took on all the essence of sharp cheddar and rosemary and it was so off putting.

1315,NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Zhu Stephanie,10 months ago,5,"(Translated by Google) This coffee shop located on Bay St in downtown Toronto is actually a branch. I remember going to the old shop in the early years. It is near George Brown College, and the old shop is relatively small.
This branch has a lot of atmosphere. As soon as you enter the store, you can feel the atmosphere of Japanese simplicity. Vertical grain wood strips are used as wall decoration, which is beautiful, chic and tasteful. There are enough guests, and the characteristic wooden table with log design is very large, and the whole feeling is very comfortable.
The cashier area is big enough, and the clerk is busy making coffee.
The eye-catching ones are colorful Japanese cake desserts. The roll cake selection is mouth-watering, and I immediately ordered a piece of [Maple Walnut Roll Cake] and added a cup of latte. Sit down and enjoy!
The cake looks good, the cream is not too sweet, and the taste is okay. The latte is smooth!
‚ùáÔ∏èIn general, I feel that both the environment and the production are pretty good. Many people take out desserts, next time you can try puffs and other Western-style buns. Good looks are pleasing to the eye!

Their baristas were used to be polite and nice, but now they've changed. I asked for an iced americano and the barista didn't hear it right so they made a wrong coffee (an iced latte). I was okay with that and asked to make it again for me. But they never apologized or asked for a refund unless I told them to. I know it is just a few dollars but this is not right.. You should've gone ahead and asked your customer first that you charged more because you got wrong orders.
I got a refund and paid a right amount again, but the fact that I had to raise this up by myself without hearing any apologies from them is very disappointing.

I went this place a week later again to grab a coffee but the lady who worked there was not polite and nice at all. She was just staring at me when I stood in front of the cashier to order. What an awkward moment! She didn't asked me what to orser so I just told her my drinks and food. She didn't say a word...I don't feel welcomed in this place anymore and feel ignored. I understand that people have bad days, busy days or whatsoever but you should not bring your mood to your workplace and express that feelings to your customers. That's very unprofessional.

Tried a lot of pastries and coffee/tea lattes from this place over the past year thanks to covid.

Recommend:
1. Hojicha tea latte. A lot of reviewers mention matcha but hojicha is wayy better than matcha. Their hojicha is pretty solid and authentic.
2. Espresso. Their beans are delicious and baristas know how to pull a perfect shot.
3. Cookies
Matcha cookies and dark chocolate sea salt! If you don't like overly sweet cookies, you will love cookies from Neo!

Not sure:
Roll cakes- so inconsistent when it comes to quality???? Sometimes they are amazing sometimes they are soggy and gross. Hope they can do betty quality control?

1458,NEO COFFEE BAR,Bay St,Matcha Snob,2 years ago,4,"Cute Japanese coffee shop! Love the clean and minimal aesthetic. Beautiful cafe for IG photos esp. since they have pretty big windows so the lighting is pretty good. Compared to their other location, this one seems much busier and there aren't as many seats so would recommend going during off hours to avoid the crowd or be prepared to wait a bit for a spot. I've tried quite a few of their pastries and cakes and don't think there have been any that I disliked but their monthly specials are much more memorable than their daily pastries and cakes. Neo is on the pricier side, but I think it's worth it given the quality and atmosphere.

On my most recent trip, I got their March special, the matcha yuzu tiramisu. It was absolutely delicious!  The yuzu takes center stage for this dessert; the matcha is more subtle and adds a nice earthiness to complement the tart flavour from the yuzu and sweetness from the cream. Love how the yuzu cuts the heaviness of the cream and adds such a refreshing flavour! Perfect dessert to celebrate the warm Spring weather! My only complaint is the size... I wish it was triple the size! Could eat at least three cups of these!  So yummy! ‚Å£

I had two rewards cards with 11 stamps, and asked for them to be combined and used for a drip coffee. They didn't give me the extra stamp back, but that's okay. I paid for two muffins, but only received one and had to ask for the second one. The other staff member said I only got one without even checking the receipt; I asked them to check their receipt, and then they apologized and gave me my second muffin. I got my order to go and was not offered a copy of my receipt to confirm, but either they increased their prices by a lot (just shy of $17 for a local brew pourover and two blueberry muffins?), or they accidentally charged for the free drip coffee anyway :( Overall, the collection of errors within one visit made me feel like the staff and managers were not really ready; a smooth customer experience for a weekday morning takeout is essential for a mid-priced coffee and pastry shop to nail down.

1686,Coffee Island,Bay St,Sarah Yahya,3 years ago,1,"I‚Äôm not sure why this place is rated this well given how terrible my experience was. I came in looking to have an iced mocha - a very typical drink available in most cafes; but I suppose not here.

As I was asking if it was available and told no by the person at the counter, i said can I order hot mocha with ice. He said sure; but then out of nowhere the owner (or manager?) maybe in the most patronizing tone told me that it‚Äôs very important to know your drink and that the only way to make an iced mocha is by making it an ice blended drink. She continued on saying that ""you need to trust us on this; how else would you make an iced mocha if not to blend it with ice "". I held off my thought since I really didn‚Äôt  want to make any scene there; but FYI ma‚Äôam; people have been making iced mochas since forever. In my mind also, what kind of a cafe would this be with this kind of manager/owner. Even another customer next to me said in front of an employee that she‚Äôs had lots of iced mochas in other cafes.

So I went on to order and iced latte and was asked if I wanted to add a chocolate shot in it; and I said why not. But I got the drink and realized wow - I now kind of understand why; this was possibly the worst ""iced latte"" I‚Äôve ever had in my life. I‚Äôve been drinking coffee since I was 6 so I know a thing or two about the drinks; and that was by no means an iced latte. I think McDonald‚Äôs iced coffee might have been a better choice.

The only salvation for this place was the nice little patio it has with good internet; but that‚Äôs about it I‚Äôd say.

The exterior is tiny and unassuming, but when you come in, you're invited into a small, cozy space filled with greenery in the form of decor, and lots of seating. It's a very home-y atmosphere and has this unpolished vibe to it ‚Äì I liked it; it reminded me of a cafe I used to visit while in school.

I ordered a lavender latte and pistachio croissant. The barista was kind and helpful with describing the lavender latte, as I had some concerns. They were also able to sub in oat milk, as I'm a bit lactose intolerant.

I love lavender in theory, but any strong aromas of it truthfully turns me away. The latte I got was like the idea of lavender; the flavour was definitely there, but in a really subtle way, which is how I'd hoped it to be. The pistachio croissant was GREAT.

It is a coffee shop where you can sit quietly and enjoy coffee in downtown Toronto.
There are about 8 tables on the 2nd floor, so you can sit and drink coffee. The customers are quiet, and there is quiet music in the cafe, so it seems to be a good space to come and read a book or study. The staff taking the order was also very kind, so I remember going there after drinking a pleasant coffee.
