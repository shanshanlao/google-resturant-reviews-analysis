Matt Fowler,a week ago, 5 stars ,The best coffee full stop
Alex Clements,a week ago, 1 star ,"Was expecting a flat white, got a luke warm cup of oat milk with what can only be described as a sad hint of espresso."

Farah Fatima,a month ago, 5 stars ,"The latest addition to the Dineen family - this location is perfect in every way: the view, the customer service, the brilliant drinks and delicious food (special shout-out to the beef grilled cheese sandwich and pistachio muffin)"
Judge Concepcion,2 months ago, 5 stars ,"I've tried their coffee in the past, and wanted to see if they had a decent espresso. I can confidently say that it surpassed my expectations! Something so simple and basic, blew my mind with its flavour, and I'll certainly be making my way back in the new year for my morning jolt."

Federico Pizzuto,7 months ago, 4 stars ,"I went there with a lot of expectations but the latte was very average.
It wasn’t a place that really impressed me and I don’t think I would go back there."
Simon Williams-Im,8 months ago, 5 stars ,"Yes, this branch is inside the lobby of the CIBC building (I was confused by Google map’s incorrect image). The lobby area is lovely and there is a beautiful waterfall outside to enjoy as you sip on a delish brew and cake :) really enjoyed the friendly service and lovely coffee !!"

Jordan B,8 months ago, 5 stars ,
Ken Sanderson,8 months ago, 5 stars ,"Free Wi-Fi, plenty of seating options. Indoors, so it's great on cooler days or rainy times."
Amit Gupta,9 months ago, 5 stars ,"Good place to sit down and have a coffee. Ideal to have a quick business meeting near the Union bus station. Clean and hygienic. Service was fast and hassle free. Slightly expensive but the location and ambience is premium, so worth it. Had a sandwich - Mediterranean veggie sandwich , basically veggies in a bagel ; cold sandwich. Was nice. Would have been tastier if it was served hot I think :)"
U P,9 months ago, 1 star ,"Great location, exceptional service but the overall product is underwhelming for a near $8. London fog barely had a hint of bergamot - might have well just ordered steamed oat milk."

Nicole Douglas,3 years ago, 5 stars ,
Khaled Zaky,3 years ago, 5 stars ,"My go to morning espresso when I am in the financial district. This is espresso made with love and quality. There menu has a lot of amazing pastries, desserts and things to nibble on and complement my espresso. What I appreciate the most is the consistency in quality. Lots of coffee shops spin up and the quality winds down over time. Dineen raises the bar every time. This location has wifi and seats for those who want to work or even order some afternoon drinks (yes liquor is served here), I am more of a coffee guy though."

Shannon T,3 years ago, 4 stars ,"Super cute open area cafe in Commerce Court (under CIBC) in Financial District. Actually reminds me more of a bar than a coffee spot! Drinks are extremely standard, but would definitely come back for a date or a coffee chat."

Adrian Nicola,3 years ago, 5 stars ,Delicious oat milk latte.
Victor Anjos,3 years ago, 5 stars ,
Zarwah,3 years ago, 4 stars ,"Good cappuccino. The drink was well made and tastes authentic.
The chocolate croissant was nothing special. I recommend passing on the baked goods as this is the third item I have tried at Dineen that tasted like packaged baked goods. Not bad by any means but not worth the price.

Disappointed but cognizant that it is the Financial district so items everywhere are always a little marked up.

Ambiance is lovely and the decor is definitely nice! Good place for meeting a client or friend!"

Sheldon Maze,3 years ago, 5 stars ,"Not as good as the original location, but good coffee and a nice location. It's often busy, but we were able to find a seat have have a good conversation, not too loud either. I would not pick this place for work, too much foot traffic during the week."

J Espaldon,3 years ago, 4 stars ,
Justin Tiu,3 years ago, 5 stars ,"Dineen in the CIBC Commerce Court lobby is easily one of my favourite early morning coffee spots. To me, it feels like a small piece of Manhattan, before the morning rush begins. But unlike Manhattan, the barista's are always friendly and seldom even seem stressed out."

Jeff Good,4 years ago, 5 stars ,"Met my friend who was staying at the Adelaide Hotel here for drinks and to catch up. I was concerned it would be packed with the business crowd or not cool with us sitting and chatting, but the staff were awesome and very chill. The election of food isn't huge, and the drink menu is limited, but I felt right at home and would happily go back again."

Cool bar-style design.
Ideal for professionals to grab a coffee.
Line up quite long between 9-10am"

Jarylle Adriane,4 years ago, 4 stars ,It was alright. I kinda felt I was treated rudely by one of the barista I asked for the liquid sugar. They pointed me on the condiments bar where they thought it was located but I told them it wasn’t there and ended up walking on the other side to grab it. But its ok
