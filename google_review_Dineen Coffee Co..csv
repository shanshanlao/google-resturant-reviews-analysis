Dineen Coffee Co.,Bay St,Judge Concepcion,2 months ago, 5 stars ,"I've tried their coffee in the past, and wanted to see if they had a decent espresso. I can confidently say that it surpassed my expectations! Something so simple and basic, blew my mind with its flavour, and I'll certainly be making my way back in the new year for my morning jolt."

Dineen Coffee Co.,Bay St,Amit Gupta,9 months ago, 5 stars ,"Good place to sit down and have a coffee. Ideal to have a quick business meeting near the Union bus station. Clean and hygienic. Service was fast and hassle free. Slightly expensive but the location and ambience is premium, so worth it. Had a sandwich - Mediterranean veggie sandwich , basically veggies in a bagel ; cold sandwich. Was nice. Would have been tastier if it was served hot I think :)"
Dineen Coffee Co.,Bay St,U P,9 months ago, 1 star ,"Great location, exceptional service but the overall product is underwhelming for a near $8. London fog barely had a hint of bergamot - might have well just ordered steamed oat milk."

Dineen Coffee Co.,Bay St,Khaled Zaky,3 years ago, 5 stars ,"My go to morning espresso when I am in the financial district. This is espresso made with love and quality. There menu has a lot of amazing pastries, desserts and things to nibble on and complement my espresso. What I appreciate the most is the consistency in quality. Lots of coffee shops spin up and the quality winds down over time. Dineen raises the bar every time. This location has wifi and seats for those who want to work or even order some afternoon drinks (yes liquor is served here), I am more of a coffee guy though."

Dineen Coffee Co.,Bay St,Zarwah,3 years ago, 4 stars ,"Good cappuccino. The drink was well made and tastes authentic.
The chocolate croissant was nothing special. I recommend passing on the baked goods as this is the third item I have tried at Dineen that tasted like packaged baked goods. Not bad by any means but not worth the price.

Disappointed but cognizant that it is the Financial district so items everywhere are always a little marked up.

Ambiance is lovely and the decor is definitely nice! Good place for meeting a client or friend!"
